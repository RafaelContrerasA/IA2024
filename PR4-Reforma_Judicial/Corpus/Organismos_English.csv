"Well, they have already approved the judicial reform and many things are going to change, I hope and they also change the policy of social security. This pï¿1/2sima.. that they get rid of all those people who. They are useless"
"Change always causes uncertainty, but taking away privileges and nepotism in this power is a good start, now the administration of justice will be seen over time."
Let the next reform be to the prosecutors' offices that are full of corruption
"In the prosecutors there is also corruption and impunity, it is necessary to reform the prosecutors"
The overwhelming majority of Mexicans support and celebrate the approval of the reform. Long live the Mexican people!
"Practically they are raising the top of those who do nothing for the people, they only serve them, what is the problem or what is wrong with that?"
"Possibly not, it will not reduce corruption, but at least it will take away the excessive luxuries and salaries that ministers had. It is already profit."
This is the most democratic thing that can exist in the world
"Congratulations to all Mexicans 

Congratulations!!!!
The reform of the judiciary is a fact "
Applause.
Very good so I agree
Time will be the one to answer this.
IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE CORRUPT JUDGES AND ALL THEIR BOSSES
They said it in the opposite way: the Disciplinary Tribunal is the one that will hear the complaints and the procedures of the public servants
We too must vote in trials electronically and sentence criminals
At least we will be able to claim and denounce corrupt officials.
"These guys were served with the big spoon, finally they ran out of their little gold "
Treatment in state local and regional prosecutors' offices
Hopefully they are not the same and that they are not on the side of organized crime
"Excellent!.
Long live our beloved leader!."
The model that is presented is very good and over time it will be better strengthened
"Even the most in silence understands it, you don't need to be a genius, you won't see ROBADERA anymore, now the money belongs to the people,"
"If I don't vote for presidents, let alone judges, what a shame for such a trivial reform, but one that can even put the Mexican economy at risk"
"Zapatero to his shoes, it is the responsibility of those who know about the subject. Don't confuse the nation anymore"
Total support for our Mexico
EXCELLENT 
"Brilliant this reform is great and timely, it was already urgent"
"TO ALL PARTICIPANTS WHO
PUBLISH THEM IN THE NEWSPAPERS
MOST IMPORTANT AND THE CHOSEN ONES
IN THE FEDERAL OFFICIAL GAZETTE AND ON THE PLATFORMS THROUGH THE INTERNET."
"How Mexican gives me satisfaction that this reform has been approved and thus put an end to corruption and privileges of judges who, in addition to receiving amounts of money, had 4 or more relatives working in the Judiciary."
"It is a perfect reform, which will guarantee prompt and expeditious justice for all. It will take time like any process. Very calm my people."
"God provides for everything to go well, we trust in everything that makes cotton cabi"
The reform requires a thorough review of all members of the court
"Local prosecutors who are corrupt may be brought to trial in federal courts. So yes, local outcomes will also be affected positively or negatively."
Now I'm done with the privileged ??
What will change? that politicians disguised themselves as judges and magistrates
"Well, I'm fed up... that the rats go free for lack of due process. Even when the thugs confess guilt."
"To give the people of Mexico in the MODERATION, and to be the one who continues to govern, is stupid as they want to do it, the citizens do not know them"
Let's hope so.
"That is an explanation on the part of morena..  Now we have to listen to the other side. .. because it is obvious that the president who took this out .. they are going to ""camouflage"" everything. Now we just need to see the other part."
How good and that they investigate the reputation of the judges and what family they come from if they are prostitutes or malicious!!
should be every 6 years
"Excellent changes, I don't see how they say that we are on the way to being like Venezuela "
Very well
And the prosecutors' offices for when?
Very good renovation
"I think the model of protocols and filters to elect the minister is excellent, Judicial Reform "
"I am struck by the fact that the reform changes ""those who have exercised legal work"" to ""elected by the people"". In other words, a lawyer who has dedicated himself to running a company instead of practicing as a lawyer, who is now a millionaire, who is charismatic and can become a potential politician has a better chance of becoming a judge"
Bravissimo PODER JUDICIAL POPULAR the opposition and Piï¿1/2a are ? RELEV? ANTES
"Unfortunately, in a city where the votes are not so analyzed by people with low education, it is difficult to reach a healthy and convenient democracy, since the parties are in charge of giving ""support"" in exchange for votes and thus achieve their candidates ""triumphant by majority"" a majority that is not involved in researching and knowing what they are voting for."
"AMLO's Reform is fine, there will be less comprsdazo and less finger-pointing "
As long as there is no one behind them demanding and observing them. They will do their own thing..
"I think it's a great law. Throw to help with the greatest evil of our peoples, corruption"
What about the judicial career?
And those in the Senate are qualified?
"I am sure that the reform has areas of opportunity and correction that must be done, but it is good news for a change to be made in justice, if it is good or bad only time will tell."
And why do those who are in their king's bed bark so much?
"ELIMINATE THE LIFE PENSION
FOR WHOM OR IN WHAT CASES???"
A couple of corrupt and hypocritical people do not take care of what is happening in Sinaloa and throughout Mexico
"Not even in its day was the peso going to collapse and neither will investments leave. The power of the media, both chairos and fifís, is not impressive."
I like it! Little by little the house is being swept away.
that's nice
"THEY SHOULD BE APPLIED IN LOCAL COURTS, WHERE JUDGES REMAIN CORRUPT. 
THERE THEY ARE IN COLLUSION WITH THE PROSECUTORS' OFFICES AND IT IS WHERE THEY ABUSE THE PEOPLE THE MOST"
Let's hope so. Although it will be gradually. No one has a magic wand.
Excellent blessings to my cool old man
"You need to clean the whole house and not just a dirty corner,"
Feet hopefully and those who comment are right
The solution to improve is good
That at the state level when attending to local issues they are left with the largest number of matters and that is where there is a lot of corruption and it affects the lower class
"AND TO CREATE AN INSTITUTION THAT WILL MONITOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE JUDICIARY AS WELL AS PUBLIC AND CORRUPT MINISTRIES. 

LONG LIVE AMLO "
It sounds good
Excellent change.
And why don't they mention that they are going to take away all their privileges?
How good and give opportunities to work to people who have knowledge in legal matters and have a job by knowledge and not by finger or sponsored
Woodrow Plains
"It will be the acquaintances, compadres of the senators, as well as the lawyers who do not have a political career will not be able to be elected, run yes, but to the 1st filter It will be as always those who have a good godfather, not the same, but it is the same."
Terrible. The proposals of 4t.
" there is a separation of parliamentary, executive and judicial powers... With this reform, the power of the impartial judge is limited, who must be chosen by public competition on the basis of merit and not as a parliamentarian who must be chosen and put to the vote... This thing is crap"
Don't ahiga corruption no more family members don't know anything they are not suitable for the position there better people who have better studies be there how good a new law was voted anyone can be that position who has that study can participate
That the prosecutors' offices be changed
THEY ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE BOTTARGA OF PIï¿1/2A....
"It is the same but now they are the ones who are going to be in all the dependencies. And since the others have their bone removed or some bone is going to be removed, they don't want to, it's like a dog, take a bone and it won't leave you"
"It was overlooking: AMLO's reforms will no longer work, and even less so in the Youth of our country. NOW it will be Bullets and NOT Hugs."
"What is going to happen in criminal matters of the common jurisdiction, how the public prosecutors will behave within the prosecutor's offices will be a very important point to deal with, do not you think, comment"
"In small towns, the public prosecutor's office is only useful to a few ay lissensiadios up to 18 years of age"
Oh nanita many are angry they are going to take your bone away
PURE GIVING ALMS TO THE POOR AND FUCKED UP TO POPULIZE THEIR CANDIDATES
"they enraptured him alone we no longer have individual grantia, because it is made by agreement. That is exactly what they did in Venezuela. and the greatest corruption is that the cenado chooses the members not suck"
"It's bullshit, the wise people don't know who to vote for, whoever gets on the brown train already has an advantage"
But when will it be applied?
Well done AMLO
The privileges are over but for the people hahahahaha
"I am studying law and I am starting, for this several professors put a debate project of the new reform of the judiciary and the vdd I am fighting for the position with a friend to be part of the team that is being made and I am nourishing myself and learning to be able to do the debate well with my team,  I would like someone to tell me that I can look for information to know more about the subject"
"Poor liver of the sold media, ""Reforms are going!"
"It sounds good, but we already know that sooner or later the crazy old man and his lackeys come out with tricks to avoid fulfilling their paths."
"Question: what will happen to the trusts?  I have a family member who retired due to illness and who is paid the same salary as when he worked, but the money is from the trusts."
What does the reform consist of? Easy. It's like a magic trick with cards. You choose a card from the cards that are put in front of you and that's it. Who chooses the cards that are put in front of you? That doesn't matter (although it's not hard to guess that the cards are from the magician).
Comments come in and they answer them? Thank you.
Thank the Yuneadores to the homeland 
"Everyone has their reasoning, who will be right??? When there is a majority, reasoning comes from power, not from reason or justice. Judicial power without partiality at the mercy of the powerful. They have achieved it now, be aware of your reasoning without remorse when they say let's make other changes without scrutinizing the truth"
You hurt me mexico! How sad to see how the country is collapsing
"What biased information, you never said that the new judges and ministers ARE NOT GOING TO BE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE BUT BY MORENA MY CHAIROREPORTER..."
Right now we will be Venezuela!!
We enter into the discussion on the Reform of the Judiciary necessary change in the face of the prevailing corruption and sale of favors?  What should Dr. Claudia Sheinbaum do? Entï¿1/2rate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeSXOSWtE0k
"Excellent news, long live AMLO, It is an honor to be with Obrador."
The same corruption but disguised as a brunette hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha they gave them atole with their finger
The fourth pack was released
They Obrador and Mrs. and the comunstas have the votes so they choose the judges by hand.
"CASES OF CORRUPTION ARE AUTOMATICALLY REDUCED. 
1 EXAMPLE... NO OFFICIAL, JUDGE OR MINISTER WILL EARN MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC.
BY APPLYING THIS ARTICLE, CORRUPTION AND IMPUNITY DECREASE!!!!!!"
The only thing that matters to me is to remain middle class 
Is it over? That we were not going to review the proposed reform of Norma Piï¿1/2a? 
"Of course, if the judges will no longer be able to apply the law in their own way, no one will reprimand them for the corruption they had in practice..."
"Hopefully they will also change skills, corrupt workers of the IMSS"
"They are on the right track, but most of the corruption is at the local level, what is below is also well rotten, it is known that you start from the top but there must also be changes to the lowest that you can, from the federal to the local"
It should be reduced to 5 should not be greater than that of the president
"The human being is corrupt by nature, nothing will change who has not stolen even a chewing gum but they feel they have values"
Liar!! Liars in the approved stay that entanglement
Very well
"If I don't vote for presidents, let alone judges, what a shame for such a trivial reform, but one that can even put the Mexican economy at risk"
Very well
"IMPORTANT. They should propose that for the election of the members of the Judicial Branch, apart from their curriculum vitae, their relationship with other officials of the Judicial Branch, the results of their examinations presented in their careers and the controversial sentences they have handed down, if any, the declaration of assets of each candidate should be made public.  With that the voters will give us a better idea of their vocation and honesty. If you agree, share, copy and paste on your social networks...."
"Minister Piï¿1/2a so far this year 2024 has spent 20 million 347 thousand pesos from the budget in personal expenses, this as they call it, has released 4 highly dangerous mafiosi..... he has García Luna's relatives working by his side...."
"I think they are wrong, the people want to know that if the judge who is going to lead the judiciary is really honest, easy and simple, no more corruption and the people know it well"
"This is easy, to be paid as a basic education teacher earns if they are going to be crying."
How cool it is to see them cry how good that people voted to get all these scourges out once and for all
"And why don't they also purge the legislative and executive branches, which corruption and nepotism is synonymous with"
"The SCJN is so necessary that if it disappears, it affects no one. A more austere judicial reform must be made, as we have already seen that luxuries do not guarantee justice or prevent corruption."
I admire the right-wingers who do not understand that they are corrupt.
"Not only the judiciary, but in all government agencies, such as those of the IMSS, the ISSSTE, the mayor, etc"
"THIS TYPE OF INTERVIEW IS VERY IMPORTANT, SINCE I CONSIDER THAT A MAJORITY OF CITIZENS DO NOT KNOW IN DETAIL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE JUDICIARY AND THESE INTERVIEWS CLARIFY SO MANY DOUBTS. IN ADDITION TO SEEING HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO CARRY OUT THIS REFORM. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THE TOTAL JUDICIAL POWER."
"And what is the fear that they will all be fired? If the Judicial Branch were effective, there would not be this type of problem. The Magistrate says that she has to decide for one of the parties in a trial, however, having the file, the evidence and legal trickery do not apply the rules or adequately found or motivate the resolutions and grant amparos and acquittals and convictions in an unlawful sense, but the investiture and the procedural locks of the laws themselves shield them from being able to appeal those resolutions,  That is why the people and society are tired of the lack of adequate, prompt, expeditious and imprecise justice."
"In Greece there was never democracy. Look at the history and its culture. In addition, the grammar of that time."
Please do not allow yourselves to be prayed for our country
"Voting is not synonymous with democracy but a tool of it, if a vote helps to concentrate power it is undemocratic."
Not letting the judicial reform pass save Mexico
"The pros are for the judges, who will no longer be able to profit, and abusing the position the rest is good, not impunity, not abuse better justice."
Everything that he defends in favor of reform is perfectible But they are imposing something that not even they guarantee because they do not even know it
They are all corrupt and will continue to be corrupt
"He sends it from those who do not have because of their studies, ignorance and just because they want us all to be poor"
"Thank God avenge the righteous men and women who seek equity. and equality for peoples.   Vote. For Plan ,,,C,,,"
"That second teacher Javier Martin, is not professional at all, you can see that he is burned. "
"Listening to it, the only thing that is most evident is the amount of ignorance with which we are being governed"
It is a luxury that there are changes of that is about moving forward and ending nepotism
"You almost don't see Javier Martinez, who is a PRI member, but it's obvious that they are embarrassed to even say that he is in favor of them hahaha"
The people don't even know what you're talking about
"And do not be afraid of the people, Remember the people put and the people Take away, and the people are already angry at having accomplices of the misfortune of Mexico."
Full Support To Minister Norma Piï¿1/2a
"Of course, there is pure nepotism in government positions"
It is an undoubted improvement for the benefit of the people. The simple fact that judges and notaries earn fairly and not the extra-spherical amounts they earn today.
"If corruption is going to end with the vote of the people, let's dedicate ourselves to voting for everything"
The pros are of the vast majority and the cons of a minority so you have to respect the great majority.
"Congratulations to the Mexican people, Brazil also needs a judicial reform, we have one of the most expensive judiciary in the world and even so, a lot of corruption, there is no law to punish the rich"
"IF THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY, WHY IS IT BEING CALLED? WELL, BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE IN THAT POSITION DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING MORE THAN CHARGE AT THEIR CONVENIENCE, AND WHAT THEY EARN, IN THE END THE PEOPLE ASK THEM FOR IT. IF THEY DON'T WORK, GET OUT; THAT THE LINE IS LONG."
"PATRIOTS ARE REQUIRED, DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO OFFEND YOU AS TRAITORS.
THAT SENATORS FROM MC, PRI AND PAN BE INVITED TO VOTE TOGETHER WITH MORENA AND ALLIES FOR THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY, THEY WILL BE ADMIRED FOR THEIR COURAGE AND WE WILL RECOGNIZE THEM AS PATRIOTS"
"He will be very doctoral, but his analysis is right."
And he talks about nepotism and how many of Monreal's relatives are in sacatecas and there are many more than those of the only ones that are justifiable
you should not run around.
"Like if the judges were going to give you a receipt for how much you gave them as a bribe and so you have proof of corruption hahah or tra is that the one who has money always wins a win, the judges are to the highest bidder"
"That they lower his salary in the s c j n  
If he is not there to defend the country, let them resign"
Explain why you acquitted Rosario Roble a. Lic Colladop
"Collado, Mario Marin, Rosario Robles, etc they won well wow hahahaha"
"A total clean-up of the judiciary is urgent, now the power is held by the people."
Because they don't expect 2030 to do so very calmly
For me it seems to be to do an audit to each one and they pass what is not good work to me donate it to me ball of .......
Hahaha it hurts them a lot when the people tell them that they are bad. The people are tired of their despotism and corruption
I know they should go away
50 plus one is a majority but199999999 the difference much more so that they do not allege a bunch of corrupt
JESUS LOVES YOU SRES
Where did that lawyer get few such nefarious cases.
"Hahahaha debate ?? I don't see any ordinary guest, people from the people and affected by this judiciary and look that there are millions, here I see those who always say black if the government says white. Analysts??? My leggings"
Totally against the point of view of the magistrate. A corrupt public prosecutor took my lawyer's money from me
MORENA IS THE MAJORITY MUST OPEN THE DEBATE AND CLOSE IT
"When you have seen a peasant give an injunction to a worker to a person 
Of scarce resources when ahh but a businessman there without problem because they have the money that allows them to see why. They don't talk about it yes the people gave them the lying command this journalist is good if he calls himself"
"The opposition gives a, they talk as if they had won"
"EXCELLENT PRESENTATION BY JUDGE MARIA EMILIA MOLINA DE LA PUENTE,...
DO YOU WANT IT THAT WAY OR MORE CLEARLY?"
Everybody's going to get out
"Don't cry, yes!!!!! to reform is necessary."
Pure charros who give their opinion
Don't grill chimoso
"Greetings from the USA, I follow the debates attentively and I admire the young Israel Zamora, very intelligent."
"Javier Martinez is very ignorant, you don't know anything"
"I think it's perfect because only family and friends work there, they make you take the exam to fill the places and even if you pass it they leave you waiting on the list for them to call you and it's only for their family and friends"
It is so clear that only those who have privileges could not agree with this reform.
On the popular election there will be a great waste in propaganda...
"Viva Mexico!, I don't want a scholarship, I want an opportunity."
Because they don't clean up the prosecutors...
"These ministers and judges do not want to work and are afraid of being judged.

Full support for the reform."
May Mexico rest in peace.
"Well, it's okay, what happens is that in part there was a commodity of the PJ and there was a lot of corruption in it"
"Naaaaa, what is urgent is a legislative reform, because the judicial power of the federation only applies what the constitution indicates and guess who elaborates/repeals or modifies the laws? It is done by the Legislative Branch (which is the Congress of the Union made up of senators and deputies, in the requirements to be a senator or deputy they do not require an educational level; that is why we are as we are, in the Chamber they fight, discuss, do not respect each other.

I don't know about you, but I would prefer that a professional, example, a doctor, perform a surgery on me than someone who has no knowledge or experience."
"I think it's perfect,
1 In the PJ there was only NEPOTISM, which did not guarantee the quality of its participants.
2 Justice was only dispensed for the particular interests of those who could bribe or have power over the judges
3 The results of the PJ in the last 20 years have made its INEPTITUDE more than clear, so reform is necessary. 
4 This promotes citizen participation in judicial processes, so that we will be better aware and aware of the movements, in order to eventually make better decisions.

everything is, pure Nepobaby is dissatisfied because they are the ones who will lose their privileges,"
"Taking advantage of the reform and the popular vote, we will also be able to vote and elect doctors to attend to the lagging health sector, already taking advantage of the fact that they are doctors of the people, even if they do not have experience, there is no quarrel, it is not needed"
Today I am worth mothers.
Please deputies do not lack senators for this you are paid
Let's see if the judges work now
In favour of the reform ! And let's go for more! Hire new people!
Excellent 
"It is clear to me that we will have a better justice system and there are many lawyers who, from our position in law study, see it as a real advance for our country."
"Sessions are now public
The fact of reducing the number of ministers is wrong, only the KKas can think of it, he wants there to be fewer to manipulate.
In Venezuela Maduro did the same with a coup d'état, reducing the number of magistrates in the Supreme Court, which is the Court over there"
Waters with the last point. There's the hidden trick. ï¿1/2So that the Judiciary does not reverse laws approved by Congressï¿1/2 a Congress completely dominated by 1 single party. That's the worrying thing.
And he left the video screaming.. The judiciary is still on vacation in an alleged strike where the ? It doesn't advance.. What a bomb is going to explode 
Hahahahaha and why did they attack each other? Why can't he do his job by bribing? Ministers and judges? Hahahaha because they won't have to. Paying lawyers for years because it will be faster?  Hahaha for the people if it is a good option thousands of innocents in there and thousands of hdspt out here!! Enough!!! And even if they don't like it and even if they do a thousand marches!! They know that this is what marginalized people need
There is no freedom without plurality
"Look how convenient they do not want the Judiciary to overturn their unconstitutional laws,"
"What they say sounds really wonderful, it remains to be seen that it is true."
REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY IS URGENT!
Total anarchy again my Montesquieu
The Equal Employment Law was missing where a public servant can apply to work in the Judiciary and at the same time atone as a federal agent and take to jail corrupt public prosecutors and judges and comrades who break the law
"I think it's okay, I approve of it as a Mexican "
"The good thing about this is that it is totally cleansed of corrupt people 
And trial of the former presidents and traitors to the homeland and that they begin with Norma piï¿1/2a.!!"
To the extent that the magistrates and the CJF I work for the state judiciary and it does not affect me at all for those who believe that everything is going to change at the local level
SHOUTING FOR JUDICIAL REFORM
"Very well, who thinks about what is spent on propaganda? It would be much less than what they 11 judges receive for nothing they are corrupt and so are their close associates"
"Now the legislative and executive powers will have no counterweight or anyone to stop them, now the monster has just been unleashed to make its free judgment, and if any judge wants to oppose political judgment on him, then it is no longer worth it"
"Well, the chili is good"
Grupo Electra is preparing your money so that you pay what you owe in taxes
To communism
Changes are always good!!
Is the popular election of Thursdays and magistrates only at the federal level or will it affect the judicial powers of the states?
Because he has an eye like this? Already belongs to the black eye club??
No wonder those of the judicial branch of the federation are going to fall
"That is to say, the aspirant to the judiciary with which he complies only with being a lawyer, etc., etc. If you work in a furniture store recovering collection with that, it doesn't matter that you don't have experience and a legal career 
No pss yes! Nice reform that this executive proposed and approved, and obviously it was approved because the majority bench is brown"
Enjoy what you VOTED .  !!!!
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REFORM DOES NOT PASS?
"Look, Luisa Maria knows other things besides modeling for brunette commercials "
"My respects to Andrés, Manuel! Yes, if he is a genius!"
Yes in favor
With everything for those corrupt PJ.
"All conscientious Mexicans support the reform for the judiciary, that is why we voted for more than thirty-six million Mexicans to remove those corrupt from the judiciary"
The initiative is to overcome his witticisms of more madness
It will be his last joke before he leaves 
Yes to the judicial resignature.
We are all judicial power 
"To resolve, Xochitl president"
Another nail in the coffin of the excellent PRIAN!! 
Corrupt ministers out!!
The people should not allow the plurinominals and much less the fuero.
If we are fed up with so much abuse and nothing of true justice.
"IT CONSISTS OF PUTTING THE JUDICIARY IN ORDER, STOPPING PAYING THEM FROM THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE, FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD TO THE REMODELING OF THEIR HOUSES, ETC, ETC, ETC, MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR BECAUSE WE ARE MUCH MORE INFORMED THAN BEFORE AND WE NO LONGER FALL INTO FAKE NEWS."
"They should remove all those who are now ministers, they are bad apples. Renew."
It is necessary to clean up and punish corrupt judges
"Court ministers of high doctrinal legal knowledge and experience, honest honorable"
"Well, it's the truth, I agree. Every now and then they take out criminals for moches daily."
"I still remember when the PRI and PAN approved reforms to receive more Christmas bonus and advance more salary, etc etc"
We are fed up with so much abuse!!
MAINLY REMOVE THE CORRUPT IN THE MAGISTRATE.
I dare to think that there are very well-prepared people who for less than that salary are willing to work honestly and give everything for their country.
"We are going for plan C, that's why we voted for the majority"
"WE MUST LEARN TO SEPARATE JUSTICE FROM POLITICS let the judges do justice. Justice is applied, not reformed; laws are reformed.
The division of powers, enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years, aims to prevent the abuse of power and guarantee judicial independence.
I heard in an interview a former minister of the Court, where he strangely stated that ""justice must be reformed"" and, with all respect, it is not reformed, it is applied.
This intended reform, which is to be carried out, aims, among other things, to reduce the number of ministers; reduce the period of their assignment from 15 to 12 years; eliminate the two Chambers so that it can only be sat in plenary, that is, again, to concentrate the decision under the same persons in all matters, regardless of the subject; election by popular vote of ministers, magistrates and judges, that is, ignoring the judicial career and the achievements or successes of the members of the Judiciary and letting them be elected under the principle of ""whoever makes the best political propaganda""; but the most serious thing is the prohibition of granting suspensions against general norms, constitutional controversies and actions of unconstitutionality, that is, that no one can defend himself, not even provisionally, in the event that there are reforms that violate Human Rights
What is intended is authoritarianism and the concentration of power in a single person or party; we must not forget what history taught us in relation to governments and States where there is no division of powers, where they only deceive by making the governed believe that sovereignty resides in the people, where the Constitution or fundamental laws are modified and transformed to achieve the benefit of a few.
This so-called reform under the moniker ""let's continue to make history"" should remind us of what happened or is happening in other countries, where there is no real and effective division of powers, as was the case in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union under Stalin's regime, China, and the Soviet Union.  where from 1949 to 1976 power was centralized in the Communist Party; as in Iraq with Saddam Hussein, as the dictatorship of North Korea and, also, the dictatorship and tyranny that Venezuela is experiencing."
Why are judges and magistrates not elected by votes of the people?
"If I agree, remove all the magistrates"
Excellent 
"There only family and friends work, they make you take an exam to fill positions and even if you pass the exam they leave you waiting and never call you because they already have it given to family and friends, hopefully they will change because it is a big corruption, it seems that the judges and magistrates are the owners"
"Impressive, as they don't say everything, it's much more than what I reported!, they don't talk about pros or cons"
He also said that the Provincial Councils of the plurinominal will be extinguished
And what does Telerisa think of all this?
"Not carnal, the people cannot decide who will be the judges because about 60% of Mexico is not qualified to cast their vote in this field. The only thing it will do is to divide the unity that the judges have now, and now open a political market for the Judiciary that is even more corruptible due to the lack of privacy in information. There are things in which the people should not interfere."
"AS ARTURO SALDIVAR SAID TODAY, MORE THAN 35 MILLION MEXICANS, ALMOST 36 MILLION VOTES VOTED FOR PLAN C AND FOR MEXICANS TO ELECT OUR JUDGES AT THE POLLS, THROUGH THE POPULAR VOTE, JUSTICE IS NOT A PRIVILEGE, JUSTICE IS A RIGHT, LET'S RETURN JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO BELONG TO IT,  to the people of Mexico, so that the maximum of all rights for all people is finally a reality, thank you very much."
"The years continue to pass and the government continues to see our faces? finally the PRI comes out and we bring him back to the presidency, a candidate brings out good dances and tick tock songs and we vote him as governor, Morena with his ball of ampons snatches a power that was not seen from the PRI regime and people believe that he is the hope of Mexico... MEXICO'S WORST EVIL IS IGNORANCE "
"Thank you, thank you very much...! Corrupt judges will no longer have a place in the implementation of justice in Mexico. "
"So they have approved a variety of reforms that have affected each of the unions, it happened with the educational reform, energy reform, reforms come and go and we have all been run over by those multiple reforms, now these subjects want to be saved, no... So many of us protested the reforms and no one took them away, they continued because they will have to overthrow this ... It's a bit unfair that life is and will be."
"Extortion should be prosecuted ex officio, since it is one of the crimes with the highest impact on citizens."
.... Plan c... That is what the people voted for...
"AS ARTURO SALDIVAR SAID TODAY, They are public and known to all of us, how all this was done with the mask of supposed judicial independence, the judiciary said we are independent and we can do what we want and we do not have to explain ourselves to anyone, but they forgot that the people are not stupid and last June 2 the people sent a strong message that a That we need a different kind of justice, almost 36 million votes told the ministers, no more injustice, Enough is enough, we want a sensitive judiciary, close to the people, with humanism and fundamentally a more democratic judiciary."
We are on the right track if we are on the right track for reform
"If it is about removing the corrupt why don't we start with the heads of Morena, the governors of Morena etc... and then we analyzed a proposal that harmed Mexico at all"
"Remember something. Salinas is afraid that this will be approved, they will make him pay every penny, his friends will no longer be there to give him protection. Doriga is afraid that the extortion case of that old man, who for reasons of life lost his file, will be reopened"
"WE ALL VOTED FOR PLAN C TO TAKE AWAY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE SCJN.  AND THAT INFLUENCE IN JUDICIAL ISSUES ENDS, CORRUPTION, INJUSTICE AND IMPUNITY, LONG LIVE THE JUDICIAL REFORM ???"
"""THE STAIRS ARE SWEPT FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM""

LONG LIVE OUR MEXICAN REPUBLIC 
"
"Because the good people do not understand policies, laws, they are less immersed in their daily needs to see how to get their family ahead, because everything is already very expensive, they no longer know what to do to achieve what they earn, everything goes up and electricity, gas, water, etc. That was what the people voted for, they repeated their social programs"
"The Reform should serve to ensure that criminals in suits do go to jail and to lower the level of crimes resulting from corruption, otherwise not even the scandal is worth it."
"Excellent, those little ones 
They are very abusive
We are fed up with so much injustice"
That these reforms be made to the judiciary for the good of all. Plan C will bring good news. Every Mexican will be happy and shout with excitement when they meet them.
"That is why we voted that we will reform the judiciary that it be cleaned up, we are tired of this judicial power removing criminals from pure corruption on the part of them"
"Wow, if the ministers are put by the presidents, that's just the data so that they go to whom the supreme judges serve"
"A complete mistake!, people don't know about the subject, not all citizens are lawyers, how the hell will they know who is the best representative?, although it is known that they vote for the worst option, just because the candidate they like or is handsome, a rather silly decision, such an important function should not be left lightly and given to people who do not know the subject?"
"Yes, let it be approved!"
At this time the judges and magistrates represent the MARï¿1/2A CORINA DE Mï¿1/2XICO 
"So much money they earn, we already know whose assets and privileges are. Those who reach those positions, it is as if they won the lottery."
And not only the ministers but magistrates of the collegiate and district judges
I just remind you that last year a judge pardoned the abuse of an 8-year-old girl and let the perpetrator go free
Let it be very clear.. All the litigants who have to deal daily with their majesties the judges know that this reform has been urgent for more than 30 years...
"Already explained with apples to understand what this reform is, it seems excellent to me that it is a reality and not a utopia. Long live the 4th, long live Andrï¿1/2s Manuel, and long live Mexico"
"Without a doubt, things MUST change."
Excellent renovation
"There is no doubt that a change is needed! in the United States they vote for judges, in this way they try to do their job well to be able to be reelected, God bless Mexico, God bless their rulers give them a righteous heart to govern!"
Hopefully it will be approved 
Since they run those people and put a new one that does comply
186000 pesos salary is still a robbery of the country in the private initiative when they would earn 50000 pesos a month
They will take away their privileges 
Very well k clean up that judicial power
CRY OUT FOR JUDICIAL REFORM
"FOR YOU TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AMLITO YOU MUST DO THE SAME WITH L@S MAYORS, THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER REELECTED IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THAT THE PEOPLE PUBLICLY VOTE FOR THE ONE OF THEIR PREFERENCE AND THAT THEY LAST IN OFFICE FOR 3 YEARS AND THE VERGS"
WE ARE GOING FOR JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL REFORM PLAN C
"Various reports and studies, such as those of Transparency International and the Corruption Perceptions Index, place Mexico among the countries with the greatest problems in this area, there is a very big problem in our country of impunity, nepotism and corruption. But you must also be consistent and not allow favoritism as in the case of Yasmin Esquivel"
"We the people already know it, and the majority we gave them is for that, to remove power. Judicial and reform it, that is the order and that is how it has to be"
I'm super right-wing and for the first time I think I don't see it so bad.
"Why give them so many years?
Why not give them a shorter period and conditional on working according to the law, and at the first time they fail to dismiss them"
"simple but not bad, what do students complain about? that tomorrow they won't give them a job by levering?"
"The truth is that I think it is a good reform, only that on Twitter they crucify it a lot."
What a barbarity!! Very soon everyone will regret it because this is not good at all poor Mexicans
"Aaaaah that's why they're farting so much, because they're going to lower their huge salary"
They don't want to let go of the bone
"They have had a lot of coughing in Mexico.
I have lived for 20 years in Florida USA and always the voters have chosen the Judges."
"Until today ""justice"" is always in favor of those who have the most money, now whoever is guilty whether they have money or not, will have to pay with money for corruption or crimes that merit it, the next step is to take away the immunity of all politicians and be condemned as what they are CRIMINALS."
"Well, here we see that the minimum wage for the population of our Mexican country is too notorious."
All with a judicial career and for six years the same as the other powers
But why people are complaining so much I don't understand anything
They have already stolen. A lot without work
"AS ARTURO SALDIVAR SAID TODAY True social justice requires the trust of the people in their apparatus of justice, without social legitimacy, independence is nothing more than a mask to judge against the rights and interests of the people, social legitimacy in the justice of Mexico has been broken for a long time,  But perhaps it has never been in a worse situation than now, if we ask the people that we did it in the dialogues for the transformation six intense months, more than 400 forums, people tell you that we have an elitist justice, a justice that privileges those who have, over those who don't,  that mistreats women, that punishes poverty and not crime and that has no social legitimacy."
Another disappointment
An end to the autonomy of all government institutions
If the judicial reform 100=*%
My comment is number 300!! Congratulate me 
"That magistrates, ministers and judges also be prosecuted for corruption, theft, aligning with crime, etc. No one above justice, do not steal, do not kidnap, do not be complicit in theft, crime, etc."
"Yes, so it must be that the people decide. And if it is necessary that there is a consultation, citizen consultation. And that's democracy not as they have it, badly done"
"Those who ask to be elected would be the members of the council of the judiciary, why are they those who review the function of ministers, magistrates and district judges, but ministers should not be appointed by popular election"
"Eliminate the
Plurinominal"
"1.-One thing must be clear: the employer is the people who pay the salaries of the judiciary through the taxes that each citizen deposits as a matter of law, if the judicial reform does not satisfy the employer to whom he pays, there will always be problems through the voice of the people
2.-The one who pays the salaries of the judiciary, which is the people, obviously does not agree with resolutions where the great oligarchs who do not want to pay taxes and who stop the resources of the people of Mexico are safeguarded and protected, these great oligarchs who are protected by the judiciary, that is not serving the one who pays the salary of the judiciary, it is attacking the boss.
3.-A judicial power that is not thinking of contributing to legal certainty for those who pay their salary is totally wrong, a judicial power always has to seek justice among the governed, but it must not forget that it is the one who pays for the daily life of the three powers, the people are the patrons, the people pay the salaries of the three powers and of the three levels of government"
"In other words, in Mexico does a public servant of the judiciary earn 116 thousand dollars?"
"Rather, because we are fed up with reforms, paying very high salaries, corruption, classism, not representing the people, their privileges, their deals, letting criminals go free, it's clear to you "
"Like he doesn't explain this note much, right? And it is because although they want to look for how to misinform, many people no longer succeed, only those who out of resentment of being affected their interests criticize everything and others who out of solidarity with them too, it is no longer like before."
"I suggest that the Chapitos and the Trivagos be judges, and that Minister Zaldivar return "
HASI SE SE HACESE QUE SE HACER QUE EL PUEBLO AGREED.
Out with the corrupt judges
"Let's not forget that as long as the opponents are allowed to continue to be part of the new government, the problems; It will continue, and from bad to worse. ! Let's beware of evil in the human being! ! This is what God says in the Bible!"
"0:12 ï¿1/2It's Yeidckol Polevnsky?..... no ma, if life has treated her badly."
"God, don't let me fall by the way, don't let my heart and my mind poison them, don't let me fall into temptation and save me from my enemies love "
 yes ï¿1/2A demolish that system garbage! And let's see what comes out of the new construction.
That's good but once and for all to the prosecutors
"Those who oppose it are in total agreement because they do not want to let go of their bones,"
"This power needs a fundamental transformation, if you really want to do things well, but as every change creates uncertainty as to whether apparent justice ends or dead justice appears, if you really seek something good for Mexico, it remains to be seen and the risks that should be the minimum because in the way it is done it seems that there are risks that are not glimpsed then as thinking people for the good of Mexico"
Perfect!!!!!
Get rid of the corrupt and put the corrupt from Morena. The end!
It wasn't much of an explanation... They are afraid to report
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REFORM DOES NOT PASS?
"Excellent! And now yes, the PRIAN will no longer be able to put his foot down HAHA because there is already a majority of morena now they are sweating cold"
Now comes the cool part
"The fact that it is by popular vote is a very big problem, the judiciary is going to be politicized, I know that it is already somewhat politicized, but now it is going to be worse. Besides, let's be honest, people are going to vote for the sake of voting, because they don't investigate the candidates or anything, it's always been like that. Too bad"
"Support for reform, we need magistrates and judges who work and do it for the benefit of justice and the people."
To run those corrupt judges
"To begin with, it is the Federal PJ, the State Judicial Power will remain the same, Ministers, Magistrates and Judges by popular election? man, the Federal PJ is going to become a popularity contest instead of a Judicial career where the most prepared and capable are the ones who reach those positions"
"There in the court are full of family members, and many years in the service. That is what the critics of this regime know, but how well do the deputies and senators already seem to be inheritance for them those spaces, positions and I do not say it, so Chango Leï¿ repeats every time he throws a tantrum. Aloi is a clear example of the coins. The whole family in politics, not even if I say about the others that no one wants to talk. Greetings."
"Are those all the changes, no mmen, by reducing the amount to 9 out of 11 and having a limitation on the salary are people making such a fuss?"
"Unfortunately, little by little, Mexico is going to become the new Venezuela.
I hope I'm wrong"
"How are they going to be elected by the people, if the majority of us are ignorant in legal matters.
It's ridiculous"
My God wue webmake your perfect and holy will millions of amens millions of amens millions of amenes millions of amenes millions ee amoebes
But how can I throw for someone if I don't know how to write well or read
All those people don't earn that amount.. they earn more or less ten times the amount mentioned and the mayor earns millions and millions. . And the people find it very easy
I don't know anything about this.... Knowing how to bark at the Messiah is the only thing that occupies
15 to 12? God!! It should be 3 or 4!! 12 is too many!
"That's very good!! In the little I understand, they are cutting off the heads of all the "
"At last what the people are asking for is heard. Well, he is the one who pays them. We are fed up with so much luxury that these people give themselves at the expense of the people"
"For those who think that judges are not currently elected by the people, they are mistaken, if they are technically elected by the people, because they are elected by the senate, and the senate is the representation of the people"
Because no one talks about the fact that the only coherent reason for making this decision is to put judges and magistrates in charge of the approval of MORENA and allies? They make up the majority of Congress and now they want to have the magistrate in their power...
"Since I stopped thinking, and I stopped complaining, and I stopped having occurrences"
"Well, it looks good"
"ALWAYS CHAN GO LEO N NO ROï¿1/2A ON STAGE!?, BATHED OR NOT BATHED, ,,IS IT TO SCARE THE AUDIENCE??"
Absusrdo
"The public domain orders you not to move anything in the judiciary.... you are our worker, by the way, very treacherous to the homeland"
Claudia chema entered with a set of justice to assert justice the Mexican tried the former president bankers and inpresarios
What does the imposter do..haaaaa what she knows how to do best lie
If you are not stupid..
"The judiciary must maintain the independence of the other two. And the most prepared and not the popular ones should be there. And the prejidente boasts that he can, in the short time his results."
"The train will no longer stop its march, There is no way to smooth its march, Jethro Tull"
Let's clean house!!!
That's throwing away the nation's money
Please don't put that bastard anymore let us rest from watching and listen to that caon 6 years did little to them don't stain I was disgusted
"You comment on what is already happening today, you described the reality of all those who unfortunately know the unfortunate actions of the current judicial system."
"Judges, more than anyone else, should be judged to the full extent of the law when they fail to perform their duties or take advantage of it. The judiciary is crying out for a reform but based on the law and not on the change of hands of privileges."
"If in so many years they have acted out of favoritism and corruption. It is definitely time to do something about it, starting with adjusting so many economic privileges and power
They are public servants. 
Get to work!!"
The worst criminals free by the power of money.
"The people in power should be studied, prepared people, with ethical and moral principles and values; not people who are elected by ""popular vote"""
All support for the division of powers
"I don't know about politics, nor do I understand the powers of attorney, but this Mr. took me out of ignorance a little. Thank you"
"I wonder if the current system is already so ""good"", why there are innocent people in prison and criminals free ???"
"If I also received a salary 3 times greater than that of the President and they wanted to take it away from me, I would also attack this reform with violence and predict that it would be the end of the world if it is approved"
"IT'S GOOD THAT HE TALKS ABOUT THE REFORM, EXCELLENT VIDEO."
"I have really been hearing for days about the reform of the judiciary. So far I took the time to listen to the video 
Congratulations on the explanation, they took away many doubts.
The truth is that I do not have much knowledge, it is important to know to give an opinion on a topic 
Thanks for the information"
"I loved the explanation. Something like that I understood. How much of a law student should teachers explain themselves like this. No filler words, everything clear, good volume and diction. Excellent explanation."
"It is important that citizens can trust the judiciary, now many of us do not trust. Now they operate in favor of criminals, they are not independent."
"I like his way of narrating history, laws and giving the pros and cons of our laws"
Why do they oppose the reform of the judiciary if thanks to it the Mexican people are getting better and better ??? Is the best sense that gave us hope ?
"If a judge is corrupt, what should he go to prison, no suspending him. Carsel and/or death penalty for corruption."
"Thanks for the explanation! Good video, I wish everyone saw it that way, not that brunette or Lopez Obrador, this is not about that or it shouldn't be about that, but about impartial solutions, that's justice, I wish all Mexicans were critical and we didn't let ourselves be carried away by a political party"
"Any change is better than what we are experiencing right now.
I do want a change and if that is not the right one, let them make another and another until the best for the people is reached."
Excellent information. Thank you very much.
"Very clear and concise explanation, hopefully you understand the magnitude of the problems that this disastrous change will entail!"
"THAT THERE IS ALSO A CUP FOR THEM AND Mï¿1/2S STILL, WATCH THEM WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS SO THAT THEY DO NOT SELL THEMSELVES !! IT WILL BE VERY COMPLICATED, BUT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO END SO MANY PRIVILEGES THAT THEY HAVE!!"
"Video summary: Maybe, risk, it will happen, enough is enough! Let's give a chance for change, we are fed up with the bad administration of justice."
What a good explanation!!! Congratulations 
"I am not a lawyer but I believe that the Judiciary has always been politicized, involved in matters of economic interests, political interests, etc., the people have always suffered from the lack of application of justice, increase in organized crime for not applying the law, etc. etc."
"Friend...

Good video 
Thank you for sharing the info..
Greetings daddy"
"Corruption has nothing to do with age or experience. However, work experience, judgment and common sense are necessary."
"Excellent information, thank you very much."
"Thanks for the explanation, this one is true. MOVEMENT well said. Corruption has increased, imposition violations of the constitution and appointing people as they please."
Excellent analysis thank you very much and good channel 
"I believe that before making the change to the judiciary he should first fight the prosecutors' offices, as you see in Sinaloa, its governor etc..."
I loved your explanation 
Thank you very much for opening the field to me with this detailed explanation! 
Those who are already accustomed to their compadres of justice are the ones who argue for changes and I believe that a change for the good of the majority is the best
Very good video! I wish everyone saw it!
It must be done because the root of corruption comes from those who are supposed to fight crime and corruption.
Great explanation. Thank you so much for sharing!
"If the executive and legislative powers are elected by popular vote, I don't see why they shouldn't also elect those of the judiciary, they want to defend their so-called autonomy to continue doing their own thing."
"I am in favor of judicial reform, Mexico is evolving and this must be reasoned until its innermost nature, judges must also submit to change."
That the reform be approved.
"When you are deaf and blind we will report what is convenient for the benefit but in the past six-year terms the parties in power put and chose the ministers at their convenience, the mockery is in the excess of benefits that those at the top have and that grant protection to corrupt, politicians, drug traffickers, millionaire tax evaders and so on to those who have the money to defend themselves"
"THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.
NO.. NO.. TO THE REFORM."
"If necessary, the trials are very long and then they always end up defending the criminals"
"Perfect as you explained it. Understandable everything, thank you very much!"
"Very good explanation but with all that please look just to give us an idea..... Only here in this little video on the subject how many of us are in favor of the reform, the comments speak for themselves !! We are majority!! We are fed up with so much injustice of so many innocent prisoners and so many criminals on the loose, change is imminent and necessary !!
In favour!!!!"
I invite you to read the comments haha the town is a lot of piece the net....
"It is not only the president is all the people, eighty million Mexicans"
Very well explained
"That they earn less and do not charge even for breathing, she told them from experience, I am a lawyer and they are very corrupt"
Thanks for the information.
"I believe that we can give the opportunity to the new reform, we have been under this form of justice for years, let's have the openness of this new change, they say that the changes are good. We don't lose anything by trying."
Thank you
"Hire more people in district courts. The proposed reforms are absurd, all absurd, if they do not hire personnel in district courts"
They are excellent proposals
"DISSEMBLE, HIS COVER FOR THE CHANGES PROPOSED BY AMLO IS NOTORIOUS"
"We are going for reforms, that is why we voted"
"THE REFORM IS GOING BECAUSE IT GOES, THE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY TIRED OF SEEING HOW MANY PRIVILEGES THOSE OF THE JUDICIARY ENJOY AND THEIR WORK IS VERY Pï¿1/2SIMO, THE PEOPLE RULE, AND WELL, THE PEOPLE OF THE JUDICIARY DANCED THE CALMS"
The best thing is that there is a purge of judges and magistrates and that there are new criteria.
"You are absolutely right, Mr."
"The current judges turn a blind eye to serious problems in the country, corruption, drug trafficking, what about the 43 normalistas, the case of the massacre of 68, the mining concessions in indigenous communities, which now make sure that they want to do things right"
"Even if they have no experience, they only have to stick to the construction to be able to impart pleasure and not pay attention to moches or political powers"
"And the worst thing is to leave the governed defenseless against the laws and arbitrary acts of authority. The self-applying and hetero-applying laws without any defense to the governed, I think that here they want to justify the ignorance required in the 4th or protect criminals"
"This reform will be the greatest boost that our country needs, for explosive and higher quality investment, it clears the way for us with greater security of our assets in all their versions, business operations, labor relations, investments, property, physical integrity, conflict resolution, removing vices, mafias and deformations in the exercise of administration and administration of justice. At last a ray of light on the dark path of corruption and impunity. LONG LIVE MEXICO, LONG LIVE MEXICO, LONG LIVE MEXICO."
"It is important to maintain the complete and total autonomy of the judiciary, the INE and the INAI."
I learned something new thank you.
"Support for change, we must bet on a new revolutionary step in ideas that can change the precarious system and favoritism of some"
Thank you. Very clear information.
"This is the reform, because that way it is checked who really does their work and does not go around throwing the ball "
"CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUDICIARY!!!. For all the cases of innocent people who are in prison without a sentence, for all the guilty who are out of jail because in the courts they were lazy and did not review the evidence and files well, for all the guilty freed who pay for their freedom to judges, magistrates and lawyers...."
"Good video, greetings Emilio"
The people asked for judicial reform and Article 39 is very clear that it says that the people decide their way to modify annul all kinds of management of the government so I don't see any other way to cancel this request of the people who were almost 36 million people and no longer look for them the people decided French that they would have done that before
A change is always good if to reform.
"Hello, I understand what you think of the reform, but let's be honest, inequality is not caused by the government, but by the ministers, who are the ones who should make a counterweight and the only one who should apply justice and equality, do not want to tell us that we have a rule of law without having their privileged"
"Thank you very much for your involvement, I did not know anything about your reform that has already been approved"
"I only want the good for all Mexicans, and this reform will make us cry"
"Good evening to all the elements that make up this group and that only a few of us love this uniform of being out of conviction ? Preventive police officers and municipal traffic of this municipality and is for the 125 municipalities of the state
of Jalisco and for the municipalities that make up our Mexican Republic 

Point No. 1

In the Judicial Reform 

? 

In what instead of 11 ministers there are only 9

That proposal is fine 

2 Observation that the life pension be eliminated 

That's fine, because unfortunately, Mexican citizens, those who don't work in the municipal, state, or federal government, have to work until the age of 65 in order to access a pension 

And it is disastrous unless they have an economic capacity to be able to acquire modality 40 to be able to retire with a higher salary 

Observation No. 3 that ministers and judges are by popular election this proposal is good and there is the controversy that they will be managed by corruption by organized crime 

But it is already known that this cannot be removed 

And that's okay since every citizen is free to vote and to elect their rulers, in this situation they elect the new judges and ministers 

And the one who obtains the highest number of votes will be able to last in office from 10 to 14 years 
  
On this point, if this is the case, the reform I agree 

But everyone is free to think differently 

Here I leave you with these three important constitutional articles and I hope that you will analyze them and give me your point of view 

God bless you good night"
EXACTLY? to
If I agree with the Reform
"Here in the United States, when a criminal commits a crime, he is not only tried by a judge, but also by the people, that means that as an American caretaker once a year, you are elected to go to court and be part of the court. They choose approximately 60 citizens and the judge analyzes them to see if they are fit to judge the accused and based on that they end up choosing about 10 of the 60. It seems to me a fair system."
"VERY INTERESTING VERY WELL EXPLAINED FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT

IT HAS GOOD CHANGES AND OTHERS NOT SO MUCH,"
I do agree with the president that everything be changed to block in the judiciary all those who are now with a letter
"The judiciary is not for a few, it is not a place let's remove excessive expenses excessive salaries, it is the service of the people."
Starting with those in Mexico City.
"I really like the way you explain this subject licensed to me it is very important to know who is governing and so you will know who to vote for for the next one 
I have another important point 
I would like you to talk to us about support for people with disabilities because apparently only voters or relatives of Morena receive this support and I say this because I know it particularly"
All the Mexican people want to compensate in the first place with the rotten raises of the current Judicial Power.
"JUDGES are very prepared and dedicated people to serve, because they have the vocation and training to help those who need justice without being given a line of what they should do.    If what they say that there are some corrupt people, then they should use the path of Justice that accuses them, that they present evidence and individually that they judge them with their due process.  but without a complaint everything is mere gossip and defamation.  The people we study do not pay attention to this type of slander I BELIEVE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF POWERS AND THAT THE THREE POWERS SHOULD NOT FALL ON A SINGLE PERSON, AS THE CONSTITUTION SAYS ART.41"
Yes to judicial reform. We are with Q4
It is not only AMLO. Those of us who voted for Morena also want that reform... It is not against workers of the harmful power. Only against corrupt judges and magistrates
"Yes, that the magistrates and judges be purged and that all the bad things that are currently being corrected, that the new generations be given a chance."
I am in favor of the Reform of the Judiciary
Very interesting!!!
"More than people who are prepared and have a high level of studies in the best universities in the world, the judges of the supreme court must have.. principles, values, humility, love for the people and the most needy, impartiality and discipline, but of course, above all, to be fair and honest, BUT FOR THEM ALL THIS IS FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT IS FROM EXTRATERRESTRIALS. for they will never be able to give what they do not have"
I think the change in the judiciary is a good thing because the people long ago stopped believing in it
The judiciary needs to be reformed
"THE POINT THAT TOUCHES ON FREE ADVICE ALREADY EXISTS, IT IS THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS WHO ARE GRANTED A FREE DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR ONE"
"Justice closer to the People. Now there is more direct democracy or authentic democracy.... What we have to do is to promote awareness about the justice system and that goes from schools, homes, which is transversal."
"Good morning, of course it's bad, I don't understand anything about politics.
So with your explanation it is VERY exquisite, thank you God bless us"
Total support for our dear president AMLO AMLO AMLO
"I understand that they are not going to work if there is no wool involved, as they are used to, and the dinosaurs do not want to be displaced, but there is a lot of reason in the president, we have to give way to the best prepared youth and it is okay the shorter they last, the less they are mistreated, to eradicate corruption.   Well done AMLO"
"The capture of the Judiciary by the Government is clear, the bar associations should propose the candidates whose condition will be proven capacity and honesty...."
"What must be reformed from beginning to end must be all political positions: from presidents to the lowest positions of the executive and legislative (both chambers) at the national level and eliminate the immunity of politicians (perhaps also all armed forces) to dismiss, prosecute and sentence to serve sentences in prison and not in house arrest, in addition, he will not hold any political office again. The risks are very dangerous for the country: A militarized and fascist narco-state"
Let's go with the reform of the judiciary ï¿1/2ï¿1/2ï¿1/2 will be achieved !!
"We have always voted for corrupt presidents who make us think that we can vote for many judges, magistrates and ministers that we will not get to know, that they will have to be part of a political party and what it generates in expenses in votes etc, if there are options in favor of the citizens but it is to hook us that it is to improve,  because they don't spend more time making decisions, because so quickly we don't all know in detail the issue of the judiciary but I won't give you more power Claudia for this six-year term,
The judiciary must be independent, let's not accept reform."
"Good afternoon Mr. I did not manage to hear your name but I thank you that thanks to you I know my state, you could take a tour of the San Juan de Aragon unit the house where I grew up was on the consulate and tlacos is the only thing I remember because they swallowed me California very small Mr. thank you very much DLB ?"
"Do not confuse people, the popular vote for ministers and judges does not need to belong to any party, remember that also today both ministers and judges also pursue interests of both parties and the minority. With the reform, the SCJN itself will be in charge of summoning the candidates for candidacies and in conjunction with the INE such as the TEPJF and CJF. The political act of a political power should not be minimized. The CPEUM indicates that we are a democratic and representative country, with this refusal to submit to the popular vote it is already any case of unconstitutionality that is being promoted by the same Judicial power when it is its responsibility to defend"
The Reform is very good. It is many millions of pesos for the judiciary.
"They must take away their privileges, their jobs, but above all their titles and the right to exercise again.  

They have mocked the people of Mexico for decades and it is they who pay them for their excesses."
The problem is that citizens do not know how to vote 
If the judicial reform were the corrupt judges and magistrates
"If he wanted to improve the country, he injected resources with good administration into education and health."
"Don't worry. In the worst case, with corruption and more than those who arrive, in the event of the failure of this new paradigm, they would be at the end of what is happening today, therefore, it will be just as rotten as the current judiciary. The worst thing would be not to try something to find an efficient and honest body. You, sir, are skewing the information."
"Political Constitution of the United Mexican States.
Article 39.- National sovereignty resides essentially and originally in the people. All public power emanates from the people and is instituted for the benefit of the people. The people have at all times the inalienable right to alter or modify the form of their government."
"Well, I don't know why there is so much fuss, if it is well known that those who are already there are corrupt, it is not noticeable"
EXCELLENT VIDEOS
11:41 It is believed and it is a reality that judges are influenced by political interests!!  Politics is a lost cause.
"IT IS TIME TO PUT AN END TO THE JUDGES WHO DO NOT DISPENSE JUSTICE AND TAKE CARE OF BUSINESSMEN WHO OWE THOUSANDS OF PESOS TO THE SAT, AN EXAMPLE IS SALINAS PLIEGO"
We cannot and should not underestimate the new generations
"Every public office must be elected by the people, period!"
"Politicians should be the best prepared people in academic matters and not just to talk and convince. As in any job in the private sector, they must have a curriculum and profile suitable for the performance of the position they are going to occupy, otherwise any donkey is in charge of a country, a state and that is why Mexico continues to be a fifth-rate country"
"It really is a bwue dream in Quintana Roo, to stop the corruption and lawsuits of organized Crï¿1/2men"
"In Spain, a similar measure was promoted by the Socialist Party, where through it different political deals have been agreed with the purpose of keeping the Socialist Party in power, although this even goes against constitutional principles."
"We want a change of judges, those who are corrupt are from the PRIAN"
"Well, hopefully it will be fulfilled.!! We are already locked from so much corruption in Mexico"
The public defender already exists
"This gentleman is defining the current work of those who work as judges and magistrates today... We have to see how the new law comes, because we are not doing well"
"In reality, today, they are at the service of criminals or, in the best of cases, of those who come to them at the price. Best regards"
"If you agree that many of us have civil cases, family cases pending and that thanks to all these protests are being delayed..."
Yes to the reform of the judiciary and the reform of the PRI and other corrupt PRI members
"Thank you for your explanation, the most excellent!. clear and precise.. Poor Mexico, and his people don't stop all this! The saying that goes, no one learns in someone else's head is good "
"It would be very good if they made transparent how much income tax is withheld from the workers of the Judicial Branch, almost half of those who pay them are deducted from taxes."
"Of course, you are for the reform of the judiciary and enough of corruption at the highest levels of justice."
The.    Power.    Judicial.       Must.       Be.      Autonomous.       And.      Without.       Invaders.     Of the.     Power.    Legislative.        Nor.    Executive.        Like this.     Of.     Simple
"AND WHO WILL SANCTION THE PRESIDENT, GOVERNORS AND MUNICIPAL PRESIDENTS. AND ALL HIS HENCHMEN"
I agree that the vote of the people as a democracy is to elect judges and magistrates as happened to it by hand and many who are there
No to the dictatorship we want a free Mexico as always
"Mr. with all the respect that you deserve me. Nowadays everything that you are announcing or communicating already exists. Whether or not the reform is done, I am almost sure that everything will remain the same."
"It is not bad for society to put judges, so it has to be everywhere, because a full democracy is not only going to vote, but that society also has control over everything state, which is also ultimately the one that puts the money to pay all of them,  I never saw that in my life that the one who finances has no right to anything, it seems that they steal the money, it only happens in the public because in the private the rules are different, it is time that society begins to become aware that the body can have control of everything and go towards a true democracy!"
"The election by popular vote of the ministers is already a sufficient reason not to accept it, and even less so with the recent occurrence of the tenant in the national palace to eliminate the judicial and labor experience"
Excellent
"This commentator why you didn't make those comments 6 years ago, you received financial support from the executive branch. If not, why do we Mexicans never hear these comments, why have they so far spoken out in favor of the executive branch? There are millions of us who recognize Amlo's patriotism"
"I think that instead of providing free advice 
They should purge the dependencies so that there is no more corruption and they take it out on the most vulnerable"
"Too bad, but everyone is very happy with the social support and as long as it is like that, there will be no criticism of power."
Excellent information
"Whether they vote or not, it is already proven that the old finger does not work, so try the vote."
"We can't be worse anymore, I'm in favor of reform"
"That is democracy, electing judges and ministers and thus the poorest also have the right to fair and free trials, no more judges appointed by finger viva morena"
La reforma no se detiene sigueeeeeeeeeeee
Already as a source of approval of AMLO's judicial reform and a goat barbecue of happiness alive amlo and his reform
"The application is very clear, I hope to be attentive so as not to be too serrated and to understand by the application that it is not very good what is happening in our Mexico"
"Avoid at all costs that judges and magistrates remain in office forever, set a time limit"
?????????????????? that everything is for the good of Mexico and for the good of Mexicans
"Judges and ministers must work for the people, as it is known that the people pay their salaries, but all over the world I see that only the rich have privileges of justice, I think that only in the United States is justice applied."
"Excellent exhibition.
Mexico is going from bad to worse"
Very biased video. A pity. Best regards
"on paper everything sounds very good, the issue is that they are proposals and there are no work plans to deal with such frequent rotations in the changes of powers,
the intention of bringing young blood to important positions as well, but there is still that risk factor of taking advantage of the vulnerabilities that a lack of experience can generate. 

Let's hope that there are more details in the work plans and not only in a vote of confidence because personally that no longer exists towards politicians."
"It doesn't matter what is done and who we choose, as long as we continue to live in this system, the consumption format will not improve, it is a complicated issue that most citizens cannot understand and even if they have access it is to take advantage and wash their hands blaming the people. We can change this format without needing a leader, we have technology to come together and build a creative society based on creative principles not of consumption"
"How interesting that what can happen with the reform, has been happening for decades in our country"
His future is assured
That's it. Better. What. A. Taken out. Ministers. Judges and. Director of the Rule
"Impunity and rights are very serious and from what I hear with young people without experience, it will be stronger, how sad, judges and ministers also need to be evaluated for their performance. Take away rights from those who do not deserve them."
For it is the bill that decides whether you are guilty or innocent that you agas what you agas
"In favor of the Judicial Reform, it has been more than demonstrated over the years how they have benefited corrupt businessmen, it is time for change and of course it hurts them to stop earning the money of salaries in addition to their good bribes"
"CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS, CONGRATULATIONS, NOW TIME CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS,,,"
"I am in favor of the judiciary. In any case, the judiciary has never really served."
"We also need reforms in the executive and legislative branches, such as halving the number of legislators and senators and also reducing funding to these political parties and also only two political parties and not one more and demanding from the president in turn the campaign promises as he said and repeated that he was going to end crime in the first six months of his term and he has not complied and health there has not complied either, a refinery that does not refine either, judge the former presidents and has not complied and so successively he has made pure whims such as continuing to indebted the country and pure puppets in the Legislative and Senate which he manipulates at will since they do not have their own will the same we need dependencies that control and monitor the president and legislators and senators on what they spend the money and be accountable because at the end of the day both the president and senators and others are only employees and public servants and let it be clear to Lopez Obrador that he is not the owner of the Mexican reputation or of Mexicans etc"
"I am against the reform of the judiciary, my support is totally for the magistrates, they are people who have years of very prepared and brilliant experience, that people vote for them to elect them ??? That is a serious mistake"
"This is how it has been taught all the time for impunity, it is better to have a new stage and the changes must be for the people and at the service of the people."
"The public defender's institute is interesting, it already exists but it is not always possible for everyone to have access to this advice, even some offices such as the state DIF take advantage of this situation and the legal advisors use the public offices as their offices and take the cases by the individual instead of sending people to the ombudsman. They should also put an end to these practices that the only beneficiaries are them, using the offices as if they were private offices and in addition they already receive a salary"
"Having a precedent on the failures of these reforms in other countries, let's also be honest, in our country there is a high level of abstentionism when it comes to voting, what awaits us and guarantees that the right people will be elected to oversee the administration of justice? In addition, the more experience a person has, it helps him to have better decisions, because he has studied and weighed more situations, I do not consider that it is easy to manipulate, you have to be alert and participate because a very important decision is at stake, because this brings a domino effect."
Excellent video to demonstrate how a media outlet can be bought to subtly try to dirty the real objective of the reform of the judiciary.
"I say Q is a good idea, the current judges don't work Well, it's better to make a drastic change!!"

"That Judicial Reform is very bad. We went through many reforms but that judicial reform did not. The workers are not to blame, the workers with their sleepless sometimes without rest, a lot of work, sometimes up to three days in a row of work without seeing their families, working until two, three in the morning, several days and only because of a judicial reform are they going to take away their jobs? They are supposed to only be for judges, magistrates and all those corrupt people at the top, not for the workers."
"I agree with the change, there is a lot of mismanagement by the magistrates, that this monopoly be ended"
"Excellent explanation, there are pros and cons, but I consider that the popular vote should not be, because justice cannot be inclined by convenience towards whoever is in power, thanks for the explanation"
"We are Mexico, we have to wait. So many reforms that others have made and, there, no one said anything. Adjustments can be made"
"The point of electing ministers and magistrates by vote already exists, THEY ARE ELECTED BY THE SENATORS, WHEN THE THREE CANDIDATES ARE SENT BY THE PRESIDENT, HE CHOOSES THEM, that is, the president and senators are elected through the vote.  the people have already given them the power to elect these officials, therefore THEY ARE ELECTED BY VOTE.  THIS IS CALLED INDIRECT VOTING
ARTICLE 76 OF CONSTITUTION"
"You excel in professionalism master communicator and in the previous six-year terms, not to mention"
"A branch of Venezuela, alert Mexicans!"
I always thought that the reform was bad. But it's pï¿1/2sima!!!! This country went to hell!
"My condolences to the beautiful Mexican people, so many mirrors to see and they didn't."
"May he be trustworthy with humanity, humility and loyalty"
"Thank you Mr. Emilio for the good information, the process to carry out this election, it is super complicated, each idea without a good organization"
I fully support the reform and the end of the privileges of the judiciary
"full support for the reform, they were taken off their blanket, they ran out of blankets."
15 years not even the president stays that long
"I only know that the prison is full of people who could not afford a lawyer and that is why I supported the new reform. And if foreign investment wants to leave, then it is only a sign that it hurts them to no longer be able to bite corrupt judges."
I don't know why so much fear of change and losing power.
"No political aims. Nor a supporter of any political party.  My opinion is, I support that reform, from what I have lived and justice is seen in the country, all the judges who are now being proposed and put forward by former presidents and the current president, I do not share that, they owe it to them and for them they will work. The explanation or my argument is very simple, in everyday life if they do me a favor, I have to return the favor, it is reciprocal.  
In this sense, proposing judges is the same, the executive cannot take charge of that issue, and finally with his video I already know which side he is on "
"They have always been the rules of the crime in question, now if like 2 ministers they are about to disappear now their interests for them please"
"For now, judges and magistrates, and probably also ministers, are influenced by the groups in political and economic power and enjoy many privileges without doing their job or deserving any privileges as they do now
Wouldn't it be better for them to be elected to lessen those influences?"
It is worth listening to without harsh and insulting criticisms.
Immediately the judicial reform
"LET'S NOT BE FOOLS, WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT THIS BODY IS GOOD BUT WELL ROTTEN, WE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR A LONG TIME, EVERYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN ALL AREAS, SO WHY DO THEY NOT WANT THE REFORM ??? ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WASTE OF RESOURCES, WITH SO MANY PRIVILEGES THAT THEY HAVE, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH LEVELS, ENOUGH OF PRIVILEGES OR ALL COLLUDES OR ALL TAILS."
"MAY CORRUPTION, NEPOTISM, CLASSISM, RACISM, OSTENTATIOUS LUXURIES FOR THE DAMNED DIVINE CASTE OF THE TOGA RING DIE."
Crocks out. Well done mexico congrats on the reform.
"CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUDICIARY!!!. For all the cases of innocent people who are in prison without a sentence, for all the guilty who are out of jail because in the courts they were lazy and did not review the evidence and files well, for all the guilty freed who pay for their freedom to judges, magistrates and lawyers...."
Very well explained
Thanks for the information
"CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUDICIARY!!!. For all the cases of innocent people who are in prison without a sentence, for all the guilty who are out of jail because in the courts they were lazy and did not review the evidence and files well, for all the guilty freed who pay for their freedom to judges, magistrates and lawyers...."
"Of course, we agree on the changes that are going to be seen, so many white-collar criminals are free."
"That reform has to be carried out if or if enough of the mockery, now the proposals are right, there is no equality in the courts, all judges and magistrates have never been at the service of the people"
6:30 The ones who should win the most are the primary and secondary teachers.
They also give the opportunity to the right to the rank to the officials who deserve it because by handing or selling the position many do not move up the position and I think that the fair thing is that they let people who demonstrate capacity and honesty within the courts move up the position
"Does anyone know what an unconstitutional act is?
What is a constitutional controversy? 

What the opposition is doing is misrepresenting so that they do not take away their judges. They are crying for their salary and because they will no longer be a nest of nepotism and corruption."
That's how it has to be with the new reform
"Yes, it is correct that there are qualified people with experience in these positions, but it is also important that there is an agency that regulates them in order to avoid corruption and nepotism and that the magistrates are enriched and enjoy privileges as a result of corruption"
"But in the reform indicates that not everyone will be able to participate in these elections, the best judges will be chosen and they will participate, it also indicates that there will be no budget to raise their campaigns, they will only participate in small debates with a time limit, which is very good,   and in any case that it is useful for Andrés Manuel López Obrador to stay in power if he is almost gone, that argument does not make sense, the consensus is to have more transparent judges and of course that people can be included in these aspects since these organizations are paid with public taxes,  And these organizations have thrown themselves against many reforms that help the most vulnerable sectors, it is true that this reform may need to be polished but it can be done in the future."
"The correct thing to do is to make designation by STATISTICS. That those who are there, ministers, magistrates, judges, defenders, councils report how many lawsuits they received in 1 year. How many of those they resolved. How many were rejected by superior. Including international courts. The best continue to work. There must be FREE local, federal and international ombudsmen's offices. **Strict SURVEILLANCE. ??"
"And perhaps all the Ministers have or had a judicial career, for example De la Mora, Alfredo Ortiz Mena did not even make his speech when he was appointed and helped in the election his political cousin as Magistrate (Otero) another who had no experience as an official, could name him many who are by hand starting with the Piï¿1/2a Norm,  There is no worse blind.."
"The reform is perfect, so in the judicial power of Jalisco they get to work, from their own experience I tell you the agents of the prosecutor are of no use especially those of group 5 
They almost wanted me to take the accused and they still get upset that I talk to them about constitutional articles fence judicial power"
"This is the basis of a different Mexico, the 4 is laying the first stone"
That is good that there are lawyers who help low-income people
"Why did he do it when he took power, lower salaries, reduce deputies and senators, remove useless expenses from the Senate chamber, in his six-year term there was a lot of corruption, more with the police, he did not ask to control anything, he renounced his pension as president or will say like the others that he earned it"
The system is more than obsolete it needs to be modified
"But the People do not know the judges, how they could vote correctly? Imagine the public expenditure of advertising to go to popular elections, I think this is a bad proposal"
"We don't know if it will work as promised by that change, but what I am convinced of and with proof!! It is that today the system is rotten and it is no longer a viable option to access Justice, and the worst thing is that my personal experience has been through 2 female district judges!!! It is a shame that it is the gender that fights the most for recognition that I have had to see in such a degrading role, since this same trial that has been in litigation for more than years and that involves minors (which the law is supposed to protect the maximum) has behaved more decent male judges than women,  but it is still a system dominated by Corruption in a cynical way in which there is nothing defensible anymore."
What hurts them the most is their retirement and their salary
"It is good to publicize the new reforms, what I see wrong is that they should not give an opinion on what it means or what it affects because there is a bias in the interpretation of the content."
"The justice system in Mexico has always been rotten, the reform of the judiciary sounds risky, but if we don't do something different, it will always be the same result."
I do not agree with his personal assessments. Change is necessary.
We have. Personnel. Prepared. Stop. Work. In. The. Power. Judicial.. The. Rot. Ba. Pa. Outside..
We must try to make a change and give an opportunity to know if it works
"If Ricardo Anaya and the gringos oppose this reform, then we can conclude that the reform is in the interest of the people."
"I have a sister who works in a jurisdictional city she and her husband are hiding my teeth in the Ministry of Health and she and her husband have levers and they have me to bless with the petsona who is supporting me midentida I have four years fighting my spy is very small quiro jistic the person who is hiding my place is Alicia Gierrero Gonzalez I want them to investigate my folder

15:39 of agreement to sell my work in the Ministry of Health I is 15:39 e dencia by prosecutor's office and my experience is crooked with his palsnca I could not j
Do nothing they are stealing my name and I have custro even fighting my identity"
"All support to judges and magistrates,"
"Do not be angry because of the wicked or envy those who do evil. It will wither as fast as grass; Like tender green grass, it will dry up.  Put your hope in Jehovah and go on his way, when the wicked are eliminated, you will see it.  Psalm 37:1, 2, 34.  .  .  ""Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. James 4:8. "
The change of the judiciary we no longer want jackals in that power
"Political Constitution of the United Mexican States.
Article 49.- The Supreme Power of the Federation is divided for its exercise into Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.

Two or more of these powers may not be combined in a single person or corporation, nor may the Legislative be deposited in an individual, except in the case of extraordinary powers to the Executive of the Union, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29. In no other case, except as provided in the second paragraph of Article 131, shall extraordinary powers be granted to legislate."
"If there are nine ministers left, they can eliminate Lenia and the other person who does not have a title, so the magistrates would be complete"
"The only reform that the judiciary needs is that there be more courts in the common and federal courts. There are very few courts that exist for the thousands of lawsuits that there are day after day.
Not the stupidity of reform proposed by the old man who claims to be a representative of the nation."
"In any case, there is impunity and if there is a reform or a proposed change it is better"
His disagreement with the judicial reform is very evident. But the people are no longer ignorant and thank you very much to Our President AMLO for thinking of the people who leave us with the foundations to rebuild what the previous CORRUPT governments destroyed and left us a Mexico INDEBTED and with an absence of JUSTICE.
Long live amloooo and out with corrupt judges and corrupt politicians long live the amlooo people think well future for the jobenes
"How impartial the one with the voice, you don't notice who he represents.
It is a matter of making known what the Judicial Reform consists of, not of giving their biased opinions."
"At the service of the people, as it should be, not at the service of criminals."
"Well, as it is, they don't play well, don't tell me that criminals don't manipulate them, because it's okay to change, if it's not better, you can't be worse than it is"
I would love too much that you were my professor
"The people who are not in favor of the reform, please know very well that most of those who are in power do not even have studies, many are by levers, here in my beautiful municipality those who work behind the city council do not know why they are there, but they are there because they are paid very well within the DIF there are not even merely professional people even the psychologists who do not even have a degree,  Not to mention the judicial troupe in marginalized communities the patrol passes by and if they see people just wanting to drink a beer they grab them and take them as if they were criminals, I wish they did it with those who really are and if you don't want to stay locked up to fulfill your hours they prune the fine of 1500 that's the system. And I don't want to imagine in cities like CDMX"
"Good evening, regarding the years experience does not work either because I am going to celebrate 9 years of modern cyber attack and they do not pay attention to me, they do not answer me and when I go they only bring me from one place to another. New ideals are needed from recent graduates who are not ill-fed. This is my opinion without offending anyone."
"Desperation to lose their privileges, that's what they're really fighting for, they even think they want something good for Mexicans, we need new people and not corrupt, stop doing harm to Mexico and retire"
"People who are critical and against the reform should propose another reform, give options to the people, because we are the most benefited and/or affected; It is clear that the Judiciary is not efficient, and does not have the confidence of the people, who will supposedly lose."
"It makes me very sad, that they do not understand the division of powers, that is, they are independent rather they were, to say if you. You don't agree with something or if you committed a crime, but you will find the ideals of the executive they are going to prosecute you, vezuela style, they mock and make jokes but don't say that they were not arrested"
"You also mention the salaries, privileges and that they are at the service of big businessmen, tax evaders, etc. You talk as if everything is going well with the judiciary, they already have too much time in power doing very bad administration of justice"
We don't want another Maduro in Mexico! Down with the Reform proposed by AMLO
Vote for the corrupt long live Claudia prrecidenta canbio to the judiciary
"Let them change all those judges, but they are useless."
"It's true, let us hear it all of Mexico, let all those who have already become rich leave and let new ministry's judges come and don't stay indefinitely for the most 9 years only, there are people who want to stay all their livesABUSIVE"
"Let the corrupt fuckers end.
Now justice is being done"
"In medical jargon it is said that an old doctor is better than a young one, experience is necessary,"
"By popular vote it should not be. That a council of experts is in charge of doing it, sadly the people are easy to manipulate. 
Nor should they be young people without experience, those are the first to fall on the wings of any party that buys them. Right Kumamoto ??"
"The separation of powers,,,, has never existed in Mexico,,,,,,judicial independence,,,, either,,,,,the president has been the master,,,,,, we should try to change a little,,,,, for future generations"
Good review
"The judiciary is so perverted that it needs to happen.
The law!! According to it, it is prompt and expeditious.
It's a terror!!"
No matter how or what corruption will never be lacking
"Ministers have always been chosen for convenience, only in these elections President Norma Piï¿1/2a and other judges with Alito Moreno, is it not something cynical to criticize forgetting this background??"
I hope that the possibility of having the capacity to process international trials or resolutions will be contemplated to avoid legal isolation in Mexico.
"Whatever the change is, it is necessary and well. Hopefully. Everyone work. Well and have a good salary but not like those."
With money the ministers are letting several criminals go free
We agree with the proposal of the president and enough of defending the corrupt
Comment on reforming their salaries and privileges and who plays the corrupt judges who protect Salinas Pliego
"I do not agree with everything the president does, but I totally agree that he should do it hopefully and it should be done.
And let it be ï¿1/2 already! As soon as possible."
"How are we going to elect the magistrates,,. . .  I think that's where I fail him!!"
"I think that the photo with Lï¿1/2pez Obrador is enough, for many to believe that they are very good people, Excellent explanation, too bad that some do not understand it, Thank you for that good contribution "
Good for Mexico
VIVA Mï¿1/2XICO VIVA AMLO
"It is good that he should be elected by the people and for the people to the cervicio, because those who are there are the cervicio of the rich and those of power."
"It is summarized and understood as a reform to pj as taking away all their privileges from these corrupt people, which is what they cry for.
!! THE REFORM IS GOING !!"
Ministers and judges are the worst currently how many judges have removed murderers today
Only the president wants the best and many are hurt because they will no longer have too much money and the country will not be affected at all
"And the ones right now don't have like-minded people, don't suck"
"It is time to have everyone in the new Transformation 4T in favor it is time to break their corruptions and have a new system, the people are tired of maintaining the same from years ago and now that it is a good change they are already screaming ?? 4T??"
Out with the judges who extort money in the Chalco Valley
"This was my last hope of finding objective information about this reform of the judiciary, I started well but halfway through the video I began to make value judgments that clearly showed his political positionsï¿1/2"
"That they don't get paid if they don't work and how do they never work? No fart
Blessed is the reform and has already the privileges."
"The people are the ones who should be listened to, we already voted because we want a change"
More manipulated the judges .if they are already manipulated long live Mexico long live AMLO ????
The ministers are already affiliated with power groups and they do not even hide it.
"I suppose that the applicants for those positions obviously it is because they have already presented tests such as degrees, licenses or any requirement to prove that they are highly qualified. To exercise the position to which they are aspiring;  that is, that they are true professionals in the field"
"The day that the death penalty is legal and we begin to get rid of all the rapists and those involved in organized crime, I would be a happy Mexican."
Ok
"Yes, there is a lot at stake but the truth is that we are not very good to say and everything is already politicized, in my town if you are not from the party in power and you ask for help they do not give it to you and there are people who did not even finish high school and do not know anything about laws and decide yes and no. Very unfair and now I wonder how complicated it is to run an entire country"
Long live AMLO's judicial reform die Norma Pina's judicial power 
Full support for Amlo
The opinion of the opposition does not matter because there is no seriousness in them. Until when would there be a serious opposition 
"As a law student, they will be able to deceive and take advantage of those who are ignorant of the subject, but not of students or professionals, this reform is a political farce."
"How about it, because what is described is not very different from what is happening today, just look at the resolutions in Lozoya, Caro Quintero cases, and not to mention Ayotzinapa...."
I think that in the same way they have been working in the past six-year terms and they show what he is commenting on all those failures have already been experienced in this country that is why he says it 
What a good move by our president
"The person speaking uses a crucial word, ""MAY."" so we still don't know if it will happen or not.
In what if there is no ""COULD"" is the current system, that system we all know does not work."
Experience is necessary in a public office as it will be possible for a young person without experience where decision-making is very important
"Who would have thought that today the judges and players are being judged, the truth is that this is good
We all know that for years the laws and justice were only for the rich those of money who could pay"
And that there are free lawyers for many people who cannot afford a lawyer is very common so there will not be so many lawyers who take advantage of the situation of the people
Out with that proposal out with it
"This law seems incongruous to me since currently judges and magistrates who have many years of training and as you say are looking for malleable people as the person who supported them and proven that they will do what they say. Which is not at all objective when it comes to imparting justice. But as it is fully seen, the president is very upset because they do not submit to his orders. Wake up Mexico."
I hope that everyone will continue to be in favor when the country and its citizens live like in Venezuela and Bolivia. Let's see if they continue to applaud AMLO.
"It is a pity that I had confidence in the rapporteur, today I realize that he is partial in favor of those who have more and abuse the weak. He does not feel what the people suffer day after day.
That he says who he persecuted politically or judicially, or what corruption he is talking about, that of the PRI members or leonine businessmen?
Last."
"Go ahead, Mr. President AMLO.
We who are the majority vote for a better Mexico where, those who have more or who have better influence do not predominate, unfortunately the judiciary is currently rotten, Morena is a majority that is why they won democratically, enough of so much corruption that the neo-liberal governments left us, come on Morena we are the majority!!!! People have already woken up!!!"
When I entered the video I thought you were going to list the reforms. Not to judge them.
"Well, with all due respect, but with all the privileges they have during their functions and their retirement, it is a mother's joke for everyone. If necessary, this reform."
Ministers favor bad guys anyway
"Why don't they understand, many don't understand that the world is changing and that the future of a country is no longer the old ones, it's the young people here in the United States, all of that is seen from engineers, from police, firefighters, there are people who are in charge of political positions and everything, to people who do personal jobs or jobs for normal people, for people from the countries are young you have to understand the young are the ones who are going to take this country has to take care of the future"
"As if those problems you mention did not already exist. Impunity guaranteed.
This reform has to take place and naturally it does not have to be the definitive solution. But it is a good antithesis and from this will come a synthesis."
With all respect for the president if they say that he is a dictator because he does not impose the reform of the supreme court of justice as previous presidents did
"The people proposed judicial reform, we are tired of injustice.
- The poor are imprisoned, disappeared
- To date there are no culprits of the real criminals, who disappeared at the 43 from Ayotzinapan 
- Judges defend those who pay the most money and some criminals have immunity
-Judges support crime. Genaro Luna a criminal with a high degree that supposedly no one knew
- Enough is enough, urgent plan C"
"It is a clear example of polarization and perspective based on who holds power at the moment.
He talks about the risks that are run with the reform, about impunity, corruption, favoritism to various groups including drug traffickers, and the question is... Currently that does not exist, criminals are not released, there is no corruption in judges and magistrates?
Another very ironic point. An experience of 5 years is not enough to exercise legislation and justice?, why revile the youth and the energy of it? How many years did people like Francisco Zarco, the Flores Mago brothers, and so many others who with youth and energy promoted radical changes in the nation, under the pretext of an age of maturity and equanimity for those positions, involve other aspects that threaten the very right to justice.
Those who today enjoy onerous privileges are victimized, when we live in a country where the victim is the people to whom justice does not reach 'that lady does not visit the huts of the poor'.

This man assumes everything from his perspective, he describes the risks of a reform without realizing that what he describes is just what is lived today with the model of class and elitist justice.

That it be reformed?... Of course it is!
That is proposed?... also.

But with the much-vaunted 'wisdom' professed by this bunch of elitist magistrates that we have today, that they propose with a fine and genuine and disinterested criterion to their class, not that their illustrious proposal after the dialogue is to make a work stoppage, 'how ridiculous'.
With that they only demonstrate one thing that they have already made very clear... The exercise of justice does not interest them!, they are interested in preserving their interests, privileges, pensions, and leaving their 2nd, and even 3rd generation covered.

Up with Q4"
The truth is that it is better to try the reform because the judges and the whole system is very inefficient
"What are we going to celebrate from this September 15 if we are no longer going to be free.
Damn AMLI and his fourth transformation. 
So much so that he criticizes past presidents and this has been the worst for Mexico. 
Please no to this reform. 
The people never asked to be more. 
The Lord speaks of austerity and equality, so let him and his children begin.
I hope the narco disappears him"
"TO HAVE MATERIALIZED WHO DOES NOT BENEFIT CORRUPT MINISTERS, MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES APPARENTLY TO THE PEOPLE YES WHY NOT GET OUT SO SOON THE CRIMINALS AND VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE"
"No to the reform, but if they lower their salaries"
"I agree with the reform because there is a lot of violence in the family in the street because the judges do not put them, the judges catch them"
"In fact, this has always been done by corrupt judges who let the guilty go free. Hopefully now everything will change for the better with the new law"
"Mr. Pineda, with great respect for your preparation, I tell you that I do not agree with many of your conclusions.    You say that the executive is seeking to exert more control over the court.  How can this be if those eligible to be eligible to be candidates for whom the people can vote are evaluated by committees in the legislature and in the supreme court to compete. Also, the committee that oversees the decisions of the judges is composed of judges and not of the executive and not of the council of the judiciary which is composed of members of the judiciary with the president of the court as well as the president of the judiciary.   And why do you think that the election of judges by the people would be more likely that their decisions could be influenced by parties or gangsters?    How is there no such danger when electing senators and deputies and the president?"
Now are they interested in justice? In this country that word does not exist
It is assumed that if they are ministers they have to evaluate them to see if they qualify
Especially the United States is very concerned
"A reform with many good intentions 
However, knowing the politicians and their great desire to lie, this can result in total oppression 
I don't know much about laws and mechanisms but is there a way to reverse this reform?"
"He is very, very bad, now it turns out that the judges are white popcorn, he is going to Chihuahua for a dance, the people spoke"
Let the reform go and the people will also be in charge of regulating it for its proper functioning!!
"But if the predecessors did nothing, what are you complaining about?"
"Curious that he mentioned judges and ministers"" could ""be in collusion with certain political parties...... That is precisely why the reform is wanted by people as a rule of thumb who meet with Alito, in a house that is, in the dark, if he liked to dialogue he would see it done in the public light...."
"I think the reform is perfect, it is an honor to be with a bakery"
The record shows that it has never enjoyed autonomy and they were at the service of the executive.
"Corruption has always existed in all executive, legislative and judicial branches, they have always been like an auction whoever offers the most wins the case. I have seen it in my own flesh and also in the national guard. You don't even know who to believe in anymore..."
"If the judiciary does have to lower the salaries of ministers, the reform was based on"
Judges are bought off
"I am a pensioned citizen without much knowledge of the judicial reform, with this video, it was clearer to me what it is about, thank you for this video, very well explained."
The approach of this narrative is clearly an opinion of the person who expresses it that is surely considered from a point of view. The glass is half full or half empty depending on my interests.
"The national institute of public defenders already exists. The same as the supervisory body of the judges, is the federal judiciary council, rather it is intended to wrap the ignorance and ignorance of the people with these arguments. It is evident that these changes are not going to combat corruption but rather encourage it and expose an undue interference in a power that does not correspond to it. All judges would be appointed by the government, that cannot be!! A judge SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL, it goes against his nature."
"And who are the current judges and ministers? When they have made them known, has the judiciary functioned?"
"CHANGES ARE GOOD.

HE WHO DOES NOT RISK DOES NOT WIN.

IS THE HELL GOING FOR US? WELL, NOOO! WE ARE GOING TO FEEL IT "
Corrupt people out of the SCJN
"Not so much according to the least years of experience, but honestly justice in Mexico does favor the powerful NOT Mï¿1/2S!! Forward with the reform, we health personnel every year must compete with each other to be the best and have more remuneration, earn our categories because the judiciary does not? Because they must come almost 20 years to earn their millionaires and we are already left without pensions? Because some public servants are worth more than others?"
"FORMIDABLE CLARIFICATION OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY JOURNALIST, EXCELLENT ..."
"Autonomy from family power, I mean because they are pure family."
"With all respect, but they are already working like this because that has been shown because according to the statistics how many criminals have been released to perhaps you are part of or what is your interest in wanting to manipulate people, people who of course no longer believe them."
"While that can happen or it could be the opposite, I think that we will have to rehearse and then we will be able to know if it works or not, otherwise I consider it manipulation of actions, I appreciate your attention"
"It tried with its infrastructures it didn't work, it tried it with health and its new institutions and it failed, it's just crumbling what little we had and it's turning us into Venezuela 2"
Total disagreement
They are currently at the service of those with greater economic resources
"Out useless corrupt guys, new people, they will run out of their gold mine.."
"Ok. And what about the corruption of the prosecutors, police who are in favor of the government"
"Of course, there needs to be reform for all those points that are described and for them to do their work and function as they should be.   So many crimes committed by people with ample evidence and even with a video camera and they acquit or give sentencing such as giving an order in their house, possibly there is a fair judge but where is he?"
Who says that right now there are no sold judges?
"The popular vote is not good, there will be a lot of discontent and more violence in electoral rights, it must be people with experience but also with a lot of ethics"
"I LIKE THE REFORM, a change was already necessary in that sector. The current magistrates are very much in their social bubble. That position is supposed to be more of a social work and not a lucrative business. By the way, obviously not just any unprepared person will be chosen; There is a specific profile for these positions, on the other hand, this gentleman made a very harsh criticism without emphasizing the most in-depth advantages, which makes one think that the reform is very bad, but it is not so, on the contrary it has quite a few advantages."
"Thus the magistrates, senators and praetors were elected in republican Rome by plebiscites."
"Minute number three: 'currently the ministers are proposed by the president and ratified by the Senate', this is not manipulation?"
What will be the most viable proposal to improve the Judiciary?
"I didn't think it was really recorded, no if they give it forward to that proposal is yes."
He almost bought it with his word supposed that is tendential he gave me to understand which side he is on
A new form of organized crime now with political support where my Mexico is going all thanks to our politicians
Surely the judges right now do not serve certain parties. Hahahaha everything he says against is how the outgoing judges work.
I agree that the corrupt system that exists in the judiciary should be changed
"The Judiciary has always responded to interests, that supposed autonomy does not exist and never will exist, more than in theory, because in reality it is not like that, they respond to the interests of the ruling class. That the Judiciary is sought to respond to the interests of AMLO, of AMLO NO, of the 4T yes, The PJ has always responded to the governments in turn (right-wing neoliberals), but now they do not coincide with the new leadership, because they imply seeing the world in a way they do not know and attacking their own interests,  not of the judiciary, but of the class they became and represented for many, many years. Of all that AMLO has done, for me the reform of the PJ, if it is a historic watershed."
"I think that exactly all the reforms are necessary, I see all the proposals excellent because all lawyers become very corrupt with power and inefficiency is evident as well as seeking impartiality in justice? I don't know how much they pay the don but I think it's not partial hehehe"
And that it was not like that the judges in the ï¿1/2 era of the prince are wings ï¿1/2 orders of the presidentï¿1/2
"So, the prosecutors (who do not integrate the investigation folders well) are also going to be elected by the people?"
"And for the presidents, if they are elected by the people who make them think, we cannot elect judges or favor, what suits them, we can choose everything and one is the one who commands"

"Excellent explanation, this helps to understand this topic clearly, congratulations!!"
REFORM IS GOING!! THAT'S WHY WE VOTE! OUTSIDE CORRUPT@S OF THE JUDICIARY!!
"I don't share their idea of being Venezuelan, that's what they said for 6 years"
"It's fine so that it doesn't continue to happen, like the one who sentenced 40 years for collecting a tanda, the accused of exonation that is injustice,"
"The court has never been independent, the parallel powers are the ones behind them"
"The judiciary itself agrees that reform is needed,.. But then? Why do they cry now that they have water up to their necks,. In addition, let's recognize that the judiciary is rotten to the point of not being able to."
this guy has family in the judicial system... Corrupt Out of the Judiciary
"Why only the risks and not the advantages? The country needs reform, enough of mediocrity and corruption"
Corrupt out
"Levers, that's why they fluffed up, because they are mainly looking to eliminate that"
"They want to take all the powers of the State. Thus began Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Bolivia. CARE.!"
But if before entering the judges already owe favors to the president with the simple fact that they were proposed by him.
"He says that in the previous stages they do not do the work, but they never exposed it, what gain the judiciary had with this situation, nor with all this professionalization career have they managed to clarify why they leave people and politicians free by the millions and without repairing the damage,  and other poor people suffer a sentence of years"
"It has never been autonomous, always, always subordinate to each other
What is said is already done, how much narco to
They have been released,
 
."
A judge accepted a bribe to dictate in favor of a friend's wife.. that it had no reason to be. They are so corrupt that it is even scary to fall into their hands
No lifetime pension in favor with several points
"In the same way, we don't know our players, we don't know who they are or their careers."
"It is a disgusting amount of income that people receive within the Magistrate, it is a shame and a disgrace that all those people are outraged and try not to reduce their budget, knowing that they are extravagant amounts... Why don't they talk about it anymore!!"
"But he mentions the texts of the reform, so that everyone can draw their own conclusions, not manipulate the information."
"And in reality citizens are prepared in knowledge of laws, functions of the position to be performed, if in reality they have their professional ID, experience, ethics etc? It would be a danger and even more so if they ask citizens who do not even know how to read? To receive support they say that it is okay to change to reform"
"Mr. S. S. S. President and his successor, in Bolivia it was a disaster"
If we don't know them. We don't even know who they are
"Judges and magistrates should not be voted for if we already know from experience that deputies and senators are voted for and we have already seen that some arrive who do not have any studies or are of dubious reputation. Imagine the lawyers who think of registering to participate are going to arrive some good ones, others related to drug trafficking and others who by chance have luck and the bolero knows more about laws That they"
"Judicial power.... Damn it.... Which power only God has power.... The laws of the judiciary are fine.... what is wrong is who put them there, no one elected them..... Out outside....."
This report is for those who defend the judiciary so that they do not go around marching senselessly
"It would be a change
Thus one would have the right to choose
And not only feeling helpless than not 
To be able to do nothing for injustice"
"Everything is very good but I think they should plan well what they are doing, as it is to put recent graduates, they are the most influenceable, if now the narco is the one who puts and disposes I can imagine the mess that is going to be made. Just as an example, Sinaloa. They must analyze the pros and cons with a magnifying glass, not just go crazy."
"And what problems there were when Zedillo changed all the judges and magistrates, which"
"Judicial reform passed, prosecutors continue"
"I think it's an extremely great idea, privileges are over by spending the people's money"
"It's an interesting reform, but there are interesting things that could go well but there are also proposals that can go very wrong, such as the election by popular vote and not by meritocracy, it's all very strange, I don't like that, everything else is fine and I just hope that they retract the vote of judges"
And what a strange if this is how they defend those who have money
The older... more thieves besides what law do they apply if all those are sold out........ LONG LIVE AMLO
"And to him who gave the most.
He who speaks of the road has walked."
"All are studied in the position they perform only to corrupt.   Cx that you don't want to leave. The positions k aï¿1/2n have. But what k do not know k se. They are going to go to jail x corrupt.   Van k X l.  They have time to run. Flee to abandon their positions.  ,"
By people km you the country is as it is there is no justice in the country do not be quiet no one else and you know it there is no justice do not deceive society
We are about 20 years behind.   As far as the law is concerned.    NI LOPEZ O.   NOT EVEN MRS. CLAUDIA WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION THAT ALREADY EXISTS.     MONEY RULES.  THE POOR ALWAYS LOSE. .
"Please do not confuse and do not explain the reform with interests of social level or power groups, what we cannot deny is that there is corruption in the judiciary."
"God bless me.  Cï¿1/2nd President 

Listen, my lady, lawyer, that says a lot about your profession, that you exercise the lack of professionalism, ownership in your career all the time in a country, the person will be appointed president? PRE- SI - DENTE NO NO PRESIDENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SHE IS A WOMAN OR A MAN OH MY Gooo"
"PLAN C, ALL SUPPORT TO OUR PRESIDENT, 
IT'S TIME TO PUT AN END TO THE S*** OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE PRIAN"
"The opinion of the end is superfluous, we need information if inclination is political"
Any change of current government will be for the good of the people because the current judges are already very fanged to get money and if you don't agree it's your problem
"Inform yourself sir, in the reform it is proposed that the current ones in function also parricipen.... HE JUST WANTS TO CONFUSE"
It reminds me of the scobby doo cartoons who is underneath this PRI character???
To centralize power
"I mean, it would be the same corruption, but more blatant nothing changes. "
It is a reform that is going to end our country.
The people are already bleeding... and to live off the people because they are not servants but living.
"I am surprised that no one has said that this is very much from the old government of the PRI, this is basically allowing more corruption by arbitrarily moving and accusing those in charge, this only benefits the president in office"
They seek that justice be partial
"On the plus side of those changes it would be great, but on the downside, as he explains, the risks are big"
Only gasoline should go up
"it was going well but it comes out with the magic word, Venezuela But thank you for your video I am watching many where people of different ideologies speak."
Risks and what is happening now are not risks
"Of course, for us that we are not politicians or lawyers, that is how it is understood, but if it would be that we were granted the complete reform in PDF, And returning to the most classic case in this type of reform, Pontius Pilate, that the people without arguments asked for the cross, indication of Jesus, but it was what the people wanted, and that is not justice."
Hahahaha that's laughable !!!
"A question to all parties on the subject, is there really justice in Mexico?  If so, they could explain why there is so much crime without prosecution, treason is really punished?... The truth is that our country is infested with loopholes and/or legal loopholes strategically manufactured to commit misdeeds by the supposed patriots of this country"
I think some things are good because it's been many years and there were no changes
"Because once and for all we do not submit to a popular vote who is promoted to general or colonel etc... let's see what the military thinks, that they all take away their rank and that the good and wise people vote for who wins each rank..."
The magistrates already belong to power groups... What is the difference?????
"And little now, the judiciary is autonomous?"
"Mayors, deputies, lords, they are popular election and in the end they only see their own interests, forgetting the people."
"IT WILL DEFINITELY NO LONGER BE AUTONOMOUS, IT WILL BE THE SAME AS THE INE"
"Many people in their ignorance only judge because they say before we were worse, but never as now has our freedom and life been so attacked... A reform of the judiciary cannot be accepted if the president will have the power to choose due to pressure from support or threats. We should analyze the situation well before talking about the subject, let's not be crying like Venezuela that President Maduro has controlled the 3 powers and there is no way to get him out..."
The people put the people away
"The judicial system in Mexico has not been independent of the executive branch, the interests of the party in power have been handled and that is how dominance existed for decades in Mexico. It is a very complex issue and the innovations remain to be seen."
"In any case, there will be more and more ways to corrupt them or to be corrupted, there is always a way to make tricks unfortunately "
"Hahaha no mamms, that already happens with judges, they already serve the interests of some..."
"PROSECUTORS, PROSECUTORS, PROSECUTORS"
"For if they were manipulated to choose them?  Well, before they put those who they wanted, we didn't even know who they were, at least now we will know a little who they are"
"Even the international community realizes the negative effects that this reform implies, but the 35 million Mexicans who voted for the ""4T"" who do not have a p.. An idea of what is going on in their own country."
"They are afraid that the president has massive control and they do not realize that for many years they have passed laws, when the people have always been against it, for bribery."
"All the support for AMLO, the judiciary in Mexico is corrupt as it is possible that they have better salaries than judges and magistrates in the United States. I lived in the USA and I have my dual nationality and I can tell you that in the United States when there are elections people vote for the judges so why not in Mexico? To what father, then I put myself and re-elect myself again."
"Well, if those who according to the labor law protect us in the pandemic disappeared the lawsuits and I was left with nothing"
"Excellent, but I would like to know if it is correct to say ""the president"" or ""the president"". I hope you can clear up this doubt"
They want more money for the games and vans provided
"Journalists or communicators must be impartial, and now I see that all of them make comments inclined to one side or the other"
"Imagine that a feminist leader is a candidate, what a horror"
Entra más explains everything se Ollï¿1/2 bien en favor del pueblo excelente.no matter how much he wants to dirty it
"And not the crime, they don't pay the judges anymore"
"Friend, even if it hurts you, the reform was approved, hopefully and it really is the solution to so much corruption that there is in the country because you can't deny that the ay in the country don't give so much good to the subject because the young people are put to sleep with so many words you can't cover the sun with a finger na avia justice before or oy no ay más"
But currently there is the public defender's office
"You, not my fellow lawyer or not what profession you practice, 
 the truth is that it is better not to publish your type of videos watch tell me something and let me comment something in general to all the YouTube colleagues and who watch this type of videos and Mexicans like me there is a phrase often mentioned in life that says: ? ALL CHANGE
 (NO MATTER HOW BAD IT WAS)   IT'S GOOD SO WITH THAT I TELL YOU ALL THE PUBLISHER OF THAT VIDEO,    
 And it is better to stop publishing so much dirt to the new reform and iron!! The reform was approved "
Magical Thinking Reform for Magical Thinking The world is full of good intentions
" He speaks as if the judiciary is now working well, and that judges and ministers have nothing to do with drug traffickers and some white-collar criminals, please; Who do they want to deceive?"
"BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THEY WEAR DISGUISES, FOR THEIR BENEFIT. . DOES THE HEALTH SYSTEM SAY THAT IT IS BETTER THAN DENMARK'S?"
"Ha, ha, ha, ha says that the judiciary is now independent "
"It would have transformed the law by giving the death penalty to murderers, rapists, kidnappers, narcos, and anyone who violates the law and corrupts the good customs and respect that every Mexican deserves! And he doesn't go around alone raising the chicken coop making people fight, and making more divisions "
He says they could be affiliated with a party and proceed in favor of one of them or some member of the underworld as if they were not now for God's sake.
"In reality there has never been
 Division of powers"
"We must give an opinion by cerebral judgment, not viceral, until today, nothing of the amaï¿1/2 prognostics of the pseudo-specialists, has worked for them, and how good."
What is currently there is perfect?
"With all due respect,,, 
In case anyone feels, let them insult them in some paragraph,,,,,
But we all have different angles of seeing mistakes and seeing problems,
Here's how this works,,,
Personally, I think that I still don't understand, that there were prepared people, and according to the best politicians, 
According to the best television stations, the best reporters, the best policemen, and the best jobs and the best salaries, according to the best representatives of the nation,
According to what we had a political eminence, yes, but it was in their favor,,,
I repeat: but what I still don't understand is, that if we had many people who said they were the best and according to the most intelligent, then how is it that they did not see, or detect all the benefits and supports, in favor of the people,
So why did they oppose the projects of the nation, if those projects were  
For the good of the people,
To generate, 
That they did not see, or detected that to begin with, our old people were not left helpless,,?
They also delayed many people, with their newscasts, they said one thing and it was another,
They deceived us vilely,
And they were all connected,
That's the worst,
Many so correct and legal, that we were,  
We made all the payments, holdings, property taxes, and taxes until we couldn't,
Because if we evaded a payment, 
The rest you already know,
And they are such rats, traitors, and corrupt,
And then crying,,,
Greetings Mexico awake,,,,"
"I see everything as perfect, maybe only that of not having experience in his position, but if he votes he will have to be well informed to vote, but taking away lifetime pensions of enormous salaries is great in what they spend is the bad thing but I see the reform well"
"I'm so scared of these new reforms.. it doesn't sound good, God help us."
"Your analysis is in question against reform.
You should also analyze how rotten the judiciary currently is. That really the sabadazos are loose the white-collar criminals and that they use the law in favor of the potentates$"
The people have more power
"Master Emilio and Comunicreativos good day, thank you for keeping us informed. Following our Cash Cut and watching the video of Carpeta Pï¿1/2rpura the president in turn is a threat to families with SO MANY LIES"
Criminals do not require judicial reform to buy judges and magistrates. It has been doing it and will continue to do it.
#ElCartelDeLaToga
May it be like this
"Hahaha, how curious, this happens today or before the reform, they seriously go too far with their fears of what will happen or is happening"
"Lic. I think more than an informative video.
It is not aimed at criticism..."
"The best thing is that Thursdays are put by the popular vote, that journalist makes it seem that the people put their judges is the worst of the worst"
"Very good analysis, concrete and punctual"
"If the Insabi and the IMSS welfare did not work, what makes them think that this nonsense is going to work? It's going to be a disaster...."
"The important one was not the judicial reform, but the electricity reform that the judges have always overturned, we are buying electricity abroad instead of generating it totally here, I think that would benefit us more. According to what I read, we are taking more than 200 billion out of the country per year just to pay for electricity and foreign companies are not investing in wiring or infrastructure."
"Excellent video, I like to see analysis, discussions, different points of view. 

I believe that the point is not to enrich yourself as President, Judge, Magistrate or Minister, the point is to provide a service to your country, your community, your family, to the people you would like to see prosper. It is good that judges with studies and investments in certifications, courses, postgraduate degrees want to be remunerated, but if they seek public positions to achieve it, I think that we are failing there, there has to be a balance. You are not going to help a cause with your knowledge (doctors, engineers, lawyers) just for the simple fact of being well paid, or it should not be the case, I think it is a deficiency of capitalism as an aspirational model, it impacts a little on social or community responsibility that makes us all grow as a person, and gives us a value that money cannot give us.

But I do agree that this reform is the first that is being carried out in this cycle and I did not like the haste with which they are carrying it out. The chambers of deputies and senators are to propose and analyze points of view from the perspective of all Mexicans, and I think I have only seen discussions in the same direction, without debate, without exchange of ideas, without refutations, just for the simple fact of thinking ""we are from the same team"" or ""you are against it"", but I think that not everyone represents the same thing or the same people."
"The salary is the least important thing when it is assumed that those positions as well as the politicians are there for the love of Mexico, and not for the money."
"I stopped the video after 20 seconds and said to myself:
The most likely thing is that in summary I would say that the market is pending, as every time some legal modification is applied, first it is analyzed in the markets and the investment therefore goes down, affecting investments and other applicants of economy, but later it will level out or position itself in one way or another,  It is too early to deduce what will happen in the next few years.
In general, the economy has always been unstable because ironically it is only a coin in the air, which is tossed every day and its outcome is always uncertain.
In my personal opinion, without being an economic analyst or something similar, it is to save, invest and produce for the minimum that profit is, it is profit.
And on the other hand, to spend on what is necessary, the basics and to have created a fund for the so-called unforeseen expenses.
Greetings and I continue watching the video why you are never more learning."
"Thank you Luismi, very good explanation and totally objective your information."
"When Zedillo became President, he removed all the judges from the judiciary and put in those he wanted. This change made it without asking anyone and much less there was a popular vote... practically he did it in the dictatorial style. 
But no one said anything, the television media applauded and everyone calm.
But now the media is crying because the People have voted for this change."
It is difficult to support the salary of a judge in a country that is the minimum wage is 250 pesos a day while they earn 6666 pesos a day approx according to their base salary and obviously millions in benefits and bonus. Serving the people has nothing to do with living like kings
Excellent talk. Thank you Luis. I understand better about the reform. And let's hope it works 
"I CONGRATULATE YOU LUISMI, YOU ARE THE ONLY COHERENT AND CONCISE ONE. HOW WONDERFUL TO MEET SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T REDOUND ALL THE TIME, YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE MORE FOLLOWER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUIDANCE"
"I worry that the ""could politicize the judicial system"" is more likely to be ""politicize the judicial system"", all the background we have tells us that it will be so."
In memory of Marisela Escobedo!! A better reform for the victims of violence!!
"It would be great if you could answer three things. Do you think that today judges are not popularly elected?,, Well, yes, only those who are most popular in business circles are the ones who are elected. Do you think that today drug trafficking is not filtered in the judges? Anyone who affirms this is closing their eyes. For we all know how money has been released from criminals and the criminals themselves have been pardoned or granted amparos. This is the problem that many pseudo-informed people have. They are reported in the media that they are only coup plotters and are only protecting power and the money of the rich"
Luismi.. The ministers of the SCJN are the only ones who are chosen by shortlists... Judges and magistrates reach these positions through competitive examinations.
"Here the delicate thing with the argument of foreign investment is the limit of the sovereignty of a country and the exploitation of resources at low cost.  that if in past six-year terms foreign investment has come, but the economic spillover is not proportional. Just take a look at the poverty belts. in Puerto Vallarta, Cancun etc. People live on a salary that is barely enough to eat, with a quality of life, where both parents have to work, abandoning their children and who are employed by large international or national corporations as well. Clearly this one, which is not only the fault of a few politicians, but of a worldwide system is reaching its last days."
"It worries me and I don't agree. THE AGENDA OF THE SAO PAULO 2030 FORUM ADVANCES.
NEVER HAND OVER ALL POWER TO ONE PERSON OR ONE PARTY."
"And by the time they're going to come to pave my street, that man has already come and gone and I didn't comply."
"I congratulate you Luis because you gave a very balanced explanation about the reform, which should be taken as a grain of salt. I especially congratulate you because I know that your position on it in general is not favorable but you managed to give a very interesting explanation about it"
"My shares in the Mexican stock exchange, are being shut up and have affected my investments!!
And I think it could be because of this situation, I don't know if it's just Me!!"
"I think that all change is good, we live in a corrupt and unpunished state, I hope it works"
How good that things are being done as the people ask
"More than the reform itself, the dangerous thing is that Morena, having the executive power and now a majority in the legislature,
they have realized that they can make the changes and modifications they want without having a means of defense or institution to stop them.

They did not care about the protests of the workers of the judiciary, and approved the reform in a timely manner.

All that remains is to trust in the good faith of the leaders of Morena and hope that all the power they now possess does not cloud their judgment."
"If the popular election of judges is dangerous, is the popular election of presidents not?"
"Three steps ahead, and we barely saw one, greetings Luis"
"In terms of salary I disagree, it is a public position not a position of privilege to be able to get the salary of your life, if that is your goal that you are businessmen better, but for a public office it is not good, you are doing a service for your country it is not for your own benefit when we do not have a good economy or many opportunities for growth since each It's increasingly difficult to start your own company or business"
"Finally, an unbiased explanation. Thank you."
"Very well explained, totally impartial, very clear and direct and above all without doing or supporting, simply exposing the issue and its points, without grid, without controversy... Very good video!"
Let's hope that everything is for the best. What I do think is that it is very risky to be a judge and more honest. I think they should be paid very well. There is already enough corruption in the country.
"-Why are you so uninformed?
- Why do I follow Luismi Negocios"
"Absolutely agree with your opinions, I have been thinking very similar about the subject."
I think that it will take us to hell from this six-year term
"In fact, if it was discussed and to summarize it is like this:
-Popular vote

Requirements:
-Bachelor's Degree in Law with a specialization / Judicial career
-5 years of experience.

Those are the requirements to apply, now we are talking for example for the 9 magistrates, if only 9 run, then everyone wins but if 1000 run, that's where the other factors come in, for example:

Of the 1000, all meet the requirements.
Those with the best grades; From 1000 to 800
Those who have other studies; From 800 to 550
Those who do not have a criminal record; from 550 pass 300
etc. and let's say that there are 150 left and there is no other way to qualify them, then it may be that among what AMLO mentioned, make a ball of those 150 that are the best of the best and it is simply pure luck but we already have the best of all.

It's like saying, I'll make a ball for the owner of my company and those who are in are Salinas Pliego, Arturo Elías, Carlos Slim, etc. Whoever wins is going to be very good because everything has already been leaked. 

It's not that I, as a civil engineer, run and because I'm popular in my neighborhood I'm going to win, well, no, I mean.

Edit
I also forgot to mention that you should not have any link with any political party, even if you have already left and I don't know, you were one of those who pasted propaganda, you can't. You have to be oblivious to any party."
"Video, skinny."
thank you Tony Soprano
Ready to see the boy from 8 as supreme minister
"The problem is, the judges were not independent, and they did protect the most powerful."
"Well, if the river sounds it is because it carries water... And that only one party has the majority of the mandate is not good, it must have competence so that they work to be better, so they will only be able to increase everything in their favor without someone who opposes it and it is just 1 example of many things they can do without anyone questioning them anything. There should be financial and political subjects in the school to understand what the country is occupying. I lost but they only distract the new generations with the inclusion of gender and I am not simply discriminating that this topic is more viral among the little ones, that the issue of politics, finance, the environment etc.."
"THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL MUST BE A SERVANT OF THE NATION, AND HE HAS TO HAVE HIS PROFESSIONAL TRAINING WITHIN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT IS FREE AND MANDATORY TO PERFORM HIS FUNCTIONS SO YOU DO NOT NEED MASTER'S DEGREES OR DOCTORATES, I SAY THIS SO THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER WORKED IN THE GOVERNMENT KNOW AND ARE INFORMED OF HOW THE PUBLIC SERVICE WORKS"
"Thank you for your explanation, it helps me not to leave bad minds and to stay firm"
"With a salary of 130,000 or so from the President, you think that the hungry Senators and Deputies are going to want to earn less than him and without pension benefits and everything they give them???
Hypocrites!! It is what they are!"
"Even without Reform, the President can appoint Judges and Magistrates and the President is from Morena."
"As an economist you are excellent but as a lawyer you would have asked for a second opinion, when you do not have any exact data you should ask for an opinion from specialists, there are several data in your speech that are not correct... Like faceless judges, there is a figure in the amparo called impediment, it is about preventing the judge from hearing matters related to friendships, enmities, family, etc... In several cases, it is a great risk for the litigants not to know if the judge has any of these links with ""... Also what you mention about NAFTA, several chapters within oblige the parties to have quality justice, for example the opening of specialized courts in labor matters, all this will remain in limbo due to the reform and the little budget that they are going to allocate to it, in addition to the fines that will be imposed on Mexico for failing to comply with the agreement... They are transcendental issues with solid arguments that should not be left only to the opinions of such as you (with all due respect), people who really do not know about the subject, without knowledge of international conventions, laws, etc. I tell you this without wanting to offend."
"People only talk like a fool, it's not that Juan Pérez is going to run, he has requirements to even be able to run and then see if people choose them for their merits in their profession"
They can save to have their pension. It's that simple!!
"There can be no ""RICH GOVERNMENT,"" this INCLUDES the JUDICIAL POWER, with POOR PEOPLE"
"What we have to do as Mexican people is to inform ourselves and read the judicial reform, I think that the media have misinformed us a lot, and from there form our own criteria"
Now they want to value the investment of knowledge. This is how the people of Mexico live with the employers.
"I hope that now the labor reform will be approved. This choice was the revenge of the poor, let's go on to the end."
"And also the monopoly in the mine will end, I agree that we give time, the people are wise and now we have to see the fruit of the change of power."
Ah luis my.... your video exploded. Congratulations
"Minister Piï¿1/2a met with more judges and the leader of a party before the elections, I think that the judiciary cannot be more politicized. I think the reform will be good and if Morena has so much majority it is because there is no credible counterweight, all that the opposition offers is to go against what the president does without real proposals, when that changes is when there will be counterweights again, but if the current party has taken so many people out of poverty and reduced inequality it is difficult for it not to support what Propose. I hope that the leaders of the opposition will let the new generations lead the alternations because people simply don't trust them anymore."
"Hello!! Good evening., as you say we have to wait to see how this reform works and with the passage of time see the results of this reform since many people, both foreign and national, are scared by what may arise., I personally believe that the reform will be positive since we have been dragging conflicts and disagreements in the same country due to the issue of that the judges allowed themselves to be bribed by such a powerful person and there was the possibility of obtaining an injunction to avoid going to jail IF I AGREE WITH THE REFORM OF THE POPULAR VOTE."
"So much preparation of magistrates and judges and they do not like the salary that they go elsewhere, the truth is that with these salaries
They never did a job that the people recognized them"
"It is a good thing, as in every battle there are wounded and losses, but in the end it is for something good and we are going to be a world power, long live Mexico!!"
"Thank you for this concise and accurate information.

I was interested in investing outside the country."
Excellent video
"There are people with master's degrees who can't find work, 100,000 must be more than enough"
"Hi Luis, if you read this comment I leave you a suggestion.... make the video again and soak up more in the problem of not making these reforms, you imply that if a Judge earns a lot he is honest and if not he will look for a way to complete the expense, honesty does not depend on how much you earn, you are or you are not, currently they earn well above whoever you want and it is not the best who occupy the positions (as an example Piï¿1/2a and Medina Mora). Best regards"
What a great video!!
"Something that this video does not say and what many of those who comment do not know is that these supposed judges and magistrates do an exam with closed doors and they choose only family and friends, Norma piï¿1/2a put it peï¿1/2a grandson and why would it be? Haha come on that being judge and magistrate is only a family business as if it were a monarchy, it is only a privilege if you are a tycoon and negotiating with the justice of the people giving a cucumber if you are guilty or innocent, we already had an example of locking up a criminal for a few days and releasing him immediately because the judges and magistrates are colluding,  another thing if you have an academic preparation like Harvard and another sucking UNI (which is already a university that only serves for a good position but does not give you super knowledge) and you want to be a judge with a salary lower than that of the president and you want to see it as a gold mine... No Sir, it is a public position and a service for the people, if you want the title to stand out, you are not looking to be a judge or magistrate my dear naïve child! You have a thousand alternatives to do business with a good title not to see how the goose that lays the golden eggs a public position, it is the chip that the Mexican citizen has to see politics as a business! The bureaucrats who are not happy are the same ones who fight for their privileges but that is over!"
That they remove the INE ... in favour 
"6:38 for that's how it was before, when the powerful were in power or when he didn't let a reform pass, and no one complained that time why until now, they're complaining
@LuisMiNegocios"
"""Soon there will be no more judges in Berlin and there will be no amparo [...] no miller if the king does not want it that way.""

- Juan Antonio Garcia Amado"
"That they clean all the dependencies, there are already some where they give them a car every 3 or 4 years, service every more, all charged to the public treasury, apart from stratospheric salaries and their activities are not so useful."
"As you say, we have to wait and see how the bases will be for the election of ministers and judges, and there the salary of each one will surely be specified, for their knowledge and merits for each one. I don't think the government is so stupid not to see that. Even the smallest company sees that. Greetings and thank you very much. For the orientation."
"What I see now in many people is that all these changes in politics incite us as citizens to investigate, to know more about the subject in order to have a better opinion and decision. Which before was not worth investigating because politicians did what they wanted anyway."
"When an official is corrupt, even if he earns well, he will never have a filling."
"Let's see Luismi, what I don't understand is how democratizing the system endangers democracy?"
"POLITICS IS NOT TO GENERATE MONEY. If they want to win well, they should dedicate themselves to something else. That chip we have that makes us think that in politics one becomes rich, should not be already."
Good video.
"Hello, Luis! I agree with what you say and I understand the perspective or the argument that perhaps the popular election is not the best but neither has the ""meritocracy"" left us anything better than complicity to corruption. "
"There will be someone who believes that story of ""If you don't pay me well then I steal"" ??!!!"
"That's how everyone should be, neutral without political overtones"
"Something you might try to consider about salaries that seem ""little"" to you is that these people represent a POWER. It is difficult to see more than there when the only value that is contemplated is money."
"I think I should investigate more.  By binding international treaties for Mexico, the faceless Judge is prohibited."
"For the first time in my life I feel very afraid of living in Mexico, afraid not only because of how bad the security is in the streets and robbed a house but real fear of not knowing if our future is here, afraid of not knowing whether to buy a house because of all the bad things that are coming for the country"
"How good it is to be impartial and indicate that there are good things. Most importantly, we'll see how the changes work. Very well"
Internal affairs well 
"In favor, out with corruption and the corrupt!"
"If you go to work in the government with the hope of getting too rich, you better not get involved, it takes a vocation to go to work in the government, to want the well-being of the majority."
Isn't this the same reform that was made in Venezuela? And the same one that we have in Cuba?
"Who would not be satisfied with a salary of $120,000 per month?"
Congratulations Mexico
"The only ones who are elected by slates proposed by the president, presented to the Senate, are the ministers of the SCJN, unlike the federal judges and magistrates, who all come from the judicial career, which is a system in which one starts from the position of judicial officer, actuary, secretary, to judges and magistrates.  All this through exams and courses, that is, for me, it is very important to know that difference.

On the other hand, the issue of ""faceless"" judges, although at first it seems something positive seen from the perspective of the safety of the judges; however, it is not taken into account that this may result in the defendant not being able to question the competence, legality or independence of the person who is going to judge him.

In a country like Mexico, where the Prosecutors sometimes incriminate people who did not participate in the events, the citizen cannot be left defenseless. 

In general, the judicial reform does not touch the prosecutors, where everyone complains about corruption, which depends on the executive. Rather, it modifies the part of the justice system that worked best, the one that could be improved, without a doubt, but it sounds logical to you to discard the judicial career of almost 1700 judges so that their place is taken by inexperienced people?"
"In the politicization of the PJ, the ruling party in turn has the opportunity to place its people...
The truth is that this is not different from what has already been done for years with the PRI and PAN, the difference is that there will be processes that the public could see without so many movements under the table.

The salary adjustment does not justify the investment that a judge had to make to exercise his office...
Ok a good argument, the problem is that it is necessary to have an appropriate professional morals and ethics which is not taught in any university in the world, in fact, the way the PJ worked does not even allow us to analyze if these people really have a sufficient or deficient academic preparation.

And as for the opposition of the parties and politicians, their stance against ""plan c"" gives the impression that they do not recognize that there is something that stinks within the PJ, I have heard some speeches that minimally recognize that there is something wrong but the murky thing is that throughout these years they have not come out to protest (as in these days) or propose a change. I think it makes clear the opposition's conformism with the current PJ.
The only thing left for us to do is to keep a close eye on these reforms"
"1. The PJF is the power where there is less corruption because of the filters it has and the few seats it has. If that is the argument, perfect, but it should start with the Executive and Federal Branches, where there is more dirt. 
2. In the last few years Fedeicomisos have been removed from PJF (?), they handle thousands of almost a day (records support it), they should do more courts and be able to hire more people to help with so much work.
3. Judges by popular vote, in case of exceeding the limit, it will be by tï¿1/2mbola. I understand that they want to give options to more people, but honestly, it is not giving options for the sake of giving, it is seeing who is more capable of imparting something as delicate as justice. Take away experience and judicial career, you only need a minimum average of 8 and have a degree. In addition, if many people do not know their deputies or senators, how are they going to know x person who has just graduated with an average of 80? In the end you are going to vote for voting without knowing. By popular election it is certain that organized crime will enter (as in prosecutors or other powers). Who is going to finance the campaigns? Surely a recent graduate will do it or some lawyer with an average salary.
4. Disciplinary tribunal elected by Morena. If you have a problem with the government and want to report it, which side do you think it will be on?"
As if the current ones were very prepared 
"To me, yes, it worries me.
I would like you to say that people who are very well prepared and trained to be able to exercise their position in the best possible way come to that position.
Thank you."
"Well, very independent that we say it was not and I think that more vulnerable to organized crime cannot be as it already is, or now it turns out that the judiciary was impeccable?, it only remains to wait for the level of studies and work experience of the candidates to be presented so that there is meritocracy and not populism in the determination of who gets the position."
"I don't care about inflation, we were already worse with salt flats and we are still alive, we were not Venezuela as they said"
"It is not, so that they earn money it is to serve the people "
"Thank you for this clear and conscise explanation, much is heard about this topic but you did not take the trouble to clarify what it is about, only the most controversial will be highlighted."
"Well, it's always good to try something new"
"In the United States, a popular vote is used for judges."
"I don't agree with how you allow judges to have a much higher salary than a president. Many of us have dreams or want to study something we are passionate about, but the courses are very expensive.
So most people make great sacrifices to be able to pay for it. Not everything is easy in this life!"
"Judges and magistrates are not appointed by the President of the Republic, only the Ministers..."
"And now. Vote for the Police officers who ""take care of you and your property"""
"The problem that public officials had is to think that working in the government is to get rich, that mentality should not be encouraged, since those who seek wealth should become a merchant or businessman to accumulate the amount of wealth they can or want, it is necessary to establish clear limits to define what is the particular benefit and what it is to be a public official (seeks to protect the public interests of the public persons residing in a State or Nation)."
"Ayyy Luis Mi, this salary reduction is to prevent many politicians and publicly accused of being corrupt, from earning even more money than they divert"
"If the history of Mexico proves anything, it is that we always go backwards..."
I know that justice in Mexico has a price and unfortunately the poorest will never know it.
Young people were affected more by having our retirement taken away and no one.... He did nothing
"One has an opinion, but the voice of the Mexican is not going to matter, I don't even believe in the vote"
Support..
"Well, to say that there will be uncertainty in investments that due to the fact of having control in the Senate and in the Chamber of Deputies is a real absurdity. And I think that there Luis you failed to say that in PRI and PAN governments they made a total of hundreds of constitutional reforms, all in favor of ""NEOLIBERAL investors"", where Mexicans were given atole with their fingers. So please, more analysis on it"
"We have to get rid of the habit and the idea that the US gets involved where it shouldn't, we were badly accustomed to the gringos telling us this if this is not the case!"
"We are a free and sovereign country, the markets that go to the fray! I did not read the Reformation in its entirety."
"""If for them the salary is more important than the justice of the country, it is clear that they are not looking for social work, but only labor and monetary work. There is no love for the homeland and no desire for a better homeland. This justifies why the judiciary is so corruptible: they do not do their job in the ethics of the profession or for the common good of all. They should be committed to their profession and justice, not just their salary."""
"Luismi seems to have started to rely too much on social media income.

Practically he says: ""I don't know anything I'm talking about, I'm only making superficial conclusions and I don't have the slightest idea about the secondary laws that establish in detail everything that the Constitution only enunciates in a brief way because that's what laws and regulations are for."""
It would be good if the judges were convened
"And corruption since 60 years with pri and bread? I don't agree with you, even if Judge Piï¿1/2a herself was not qualified to be a judge and she was there, and we look at what they did, the terrible expenses in them, when there is poverty, I applaud what happened to them."
"But if it were a fair competition, we would de facto remove that 50% - 50%. That reflects that we don't think..."
and how do they do it? the equivalent of ministers from other countries who earn and spend in stronger currencies and who studied at universities abroad earning less money. There is the story of a character who was 7 months as a minister and has been collecting his pension for more than 25 years.
"The issue is complicated and polarized because you see the intention but you don't see the dark side of the issue 
You're taking control of everything systematically 
My opinion is that there should be a counterweight in politics for the popular good and tranquility of Mexicans"
"And there is a clean one missing, it is the agrarian one"
"This is how issues of interest such as reforms are broken down and discussed and not only by creating disturbances and divisions, Mexicans should no longer be there to make a grid, but to read, be informed and debate any issue that changes the course of the country!!"
Justice has always been for people with power and money
"People will vote for highly qualified professionals, it is understood that any of the prospects are totally suitable to fully perform the position, it is conducive given the disastrous experiences that history shows us, ""manipulated judges, put in a way, where only the one who reaches the price, will obtain justice"".
Good for the judicial reform!"
"Luis, I think that the salary of $130,000 a month is quite good, since being public servants they are not ready to become millionaires. In addition, the average salary of the Mexican is far from this amount"
It is assumed that a public servant ï¿1/2st by vocation never by economic interest!! The ethics of a public servant are more important than his personal ambitions!!
"We want a true democracy without corrupt judges with onerous salaries, that is my lord as a Mexican citizen"
"The political situation in Mexico has always been one of clear majorities, in previous six-year terms the political power of the 3 levels was co-opted by the right and everything that it soiled and did not exist as a counterweight as you refer to now, although there were constitutional modifications and strategic privatizations to leave the country without resources and without energy,  Now the situation has been turned around, there is a majority to be able to carry out the constitutional and political reforms that are wanted, only now there is a popular decision and that must seek what most benefits Mexican society, having the support of the people gives legitimacy to the decisions made by legislators and as such a moral commitment of society to be able to assume the consequences of such acts,  That does generate certainty, at least for ordinary Mexicans and being a majority also generates an uncontainable economic and political force that I consider to be more than enough to face the adversities that may come."
"The figure of faceless judges is regressive, altering the principles of impartiality and equality, since you will not know if the judge who is going to hear the case has conflicts of interest, is trained and if he or she is really going to carry out an independent trial. Just as there is data that indicates that the number of innocent people who are imprisoned in this type of matter is greater. 

The foregoing is supported by the judgments issued by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights against the States of Peru and Colombia to eliminate this figure from their legal systems."
"History has taught us that popular elections have promoted crime to put politicians in public positions, now it will happen that crime puts its own judges, simply "
Mexico will be better than ever
The reform was approved and from 20 pesos a dollar it went down to 19.50
If there was corruption before...  It will be seen as everything that Q4 did.
"AMLO you are the super hero of Mexico a historical fact against the imposing system, you are a great visionary because like the great leaders you realized the flavors that the Greeks left us from mediocre politics."
"If even so, they earned 3 times more than the president, they have money and the U.S. as their patron. 
Austerity and love for the people I show them these 6 years is what is needed
Long live AMLO!!"
"A few years ago, I met a minister of the supreme court, who had most of her nephews, working inside, some had law degrees, others were interns, and two of them only had high school, but there they were working very comfortably and earning well. Conclusion the finger above all."
They say that it is dangerous to make it a popularly elected position instead of a position that is won with merits... So the way of electing our presidents and rulers is also wrong?
The reform does affect but for the corrupt and foreign companies
You can offer millions to the judges and it still won't be enough. The position is offered to anyone who wants to offer their life for justice. Nowadays judges do not have a filling room
The Constitution establishes three independent branches.  And not one subject to the executive and legislative.
"Mexico is a country that is not prepared for this reform. He has good concepts but corruption has always reigned and will reign in Mexico, so it is not a good reform for our country."
"The president earns $186,000 a month and is on the APF's transparent page number"
The Judicial Reform does not affect us because we are not judges hahaha
"I see that you are in your position as an investor, I write it because in the video you are neutral, what good information and ideas to invest.
The dollar closed with today's price at 19.53 pesos.
Looking at the prices of the dollar and comparing them, in this administration it was reduced by .80 cents.
At the beginning it was worth 20.33 and at this moment it is worth 19.53.
I don't know why now they are interested in the price of the dollar.
For the dollar in 2012 it was worth 13.30 and closed in 2018 with 20.33.
It is not support for MORENA, but they have already forgotten the increase in pain in those years."
"Due to the lack of education in Mexico this is wrong to be by vote if that is how we do as we do every six-year term. The reduction is fine in the number. Anonymous is fine. There are good things but also bad things, life is good but as you say having such high salaries it is difficult to relocate"
"If the judges, in specific cases, will work anonymously, it will be difficult to file injunctions against flawed trials or processes. That's just for starters."
"Be careful, judges and magistrates in our country were not chosen by shortlists but by the council of the federal judiciary implementing the judicial career law"
"The main concern of the people is the impartiality of the judges, since currently, most of them are very corrupt and do not do justice for anyone, they only sell sentences as a way, through a good tip, bribe, contribution or gift."
"The reform has good things and others that are not so clear, but what will make the difference is the corruption that exists, with or without reform corruption is the biggest cancer in Mexican politics."
Obviously they will not be affiliated with any political party...
"The problem is that many of these judges have neither the studies nor the experience, the same rule as in an etevista she had never litigated"
"He is a public servant, if he wants to earn millionaire salaries, he should put his private law firm and that's it."
"WITHOUT PARTIES OR FINANCING IS THE PROPOSAL, THE BEST THING IS THAT THE FAMILIES OF THE POLITICAL CASTE WILL END THEIR LEGAL NEPOTISM"
"Salaries, my criterion, is that we have to change the way of thinking is that they are precisely PUBLIC SERVANTS in any of the 3 powers. both the president and legislators and judges. They are public service positions. We should have the best Mexicans in that area, success, etc. for a short period of time serving out of gratitude to his country. To me that means being a public servant. The problem is that they take it as a job and want to make their profession of a public service"
"Now people are going to vote for people we don't even know, we don't know their careers or their abilities"
"Good explanation! The faceless judges are very dangerous and therefore they are no longer used in Italy and in Peru (where they were first implemented) because there is a risk that not all the defendants are high-impact criminals but scapegoats or innocent, even politically persecuted, and the figure shields their judges from responsibilities against procedural violations or their human rights. Best regards"
"The president does not earn $130,000 pesos, because he has a lot of expenses that are not charged, those benefits such as educational expenses for his minor children, food, clothing, transportation, health, etc. The president, by not having to spend his money, earns much more."
"Not only do they deserve pensions but they can be reformed according to their work,"
"Improving justice in Mexico is the least sought by the reform.
To take over the last independent power that we had left in the country is what the president wants; The salaries and nepotism are pure show, because for salaries the deputies and senators who do not even know what they are doing in their seats and for nepotism the dependencies of the Executive where even the positions are inherited."
"And now let's tell the mafia ... that it is not the owner of the country. Let them unblock the roads, we pay taxes and we cannot travel calmly. Walk in the street in peace and put up a business without being charged a flat."
"I believe that any high position in any of the three branches should be there out of conviction and not for money. It is obvious that we all need money but 120 thousand pesos far exceeds what is considered upper class in Mexico, it is enough to support children, sick parents and life projects. Besides, generally someone with a PhD from Princeton, as you mention, is someone who already has a lot of money. I am not calling for mediocrity and not aspiring to a better salary, not at all. I simply think that they are positions for people who should base their lives on certain principles over money and who understand that although wealth is welcome, decisions should not be made just to seek it."
"The reform is not perfect, but it is not that we were better before, 100 years where they felt untouchable, ""How do they want to see a change if things are left the same"""
"The problem is not the election, the thing is how they manage the Constitution"
"In the current system, only the ministers of the Supreme Court are proposed by the head of the Federal Executive and ratified by the Senate
Federal judges and magistrates access the position through examinations that are divided into 3 stages: knowledge, preparation of a draft sentence and an interview; To access each stage, it is necessary to pass the previous one."
"We went from the PRI, to the PAN and then Morena. And they're all the same "
" The insertion is in the businessmen who owe billions, corrupt politicians and judges "
"Hello of course this reform is worrisome, the only country that has carried it out is Bolivia and they already have a very bad experience and continue to solve more problems derived from this, now beyond solving corruption it is aggravated and since in Mexico there is a history of bad governments,  corruption which is not over, it is difficult to see that anything good will come out of this."
"Well, I'm going to leave this here, I found it and I would like to share it with others as a particular opinion I don't do it with the intention of conflicting or making anyone change their mind, at the end of the day everyone thinks what they want, 

It's not the home of celebrities, this is really important for true independence...

Ok, I see too much ignorance regarding the issue of judicial reform, so it will take me a few lines to explain a little, I hope you read it so you can comment based on an informed opinion.

In elementary school we were taught Mexico there are 3 powers; At the federal level they are:

1. Executive (AMLO);
2. Legislative (chambers of deputies and senators; together they are the Congress of the Union; and,
3. Judicial (Federal Judicial Branch).

Currently the executive and legislative powers are mostly MORENA; that is, if the president says: ""We will no longer provide health service to the population,"" that becomes LAW, because there is no one to oppose it.

Serious situation, no?

Well, what happens? People, out of ignorance (which is not a bad thing) confuse the PJF with the police, with the MP, the ministerials, with a criminal judge, etc.

However, in the PJF Tï¿1/2, as a CITIZEN who has human rights, you go in order to request an amparo AGAINST AN AUTHORITY; that is, you don't go to the PJF to sue your neighbor, because he punctured your tires, or because he saw you ugly. 

Do you remember the pandemic? Do you remember when there were certain people who didn't want to get a vaccine because of X situation? Well, THAT is an act of authority that you can challenge in PJF (and in fact there were too many matters of that type) who will analyze your matter and, if appropriate, will grant you the amparo SO THAT THAT AUTHORITY VACCINATES YOU, but that amparo sentence will not be a request, but an order, or they dismiss the one who refuses to comply and they can put him up to jail ?.

Do we see the difference? In PJF you do not demand divorce, or any other matter between you and another person, you demand that THE AUTHORITIES RESPECT YOUR HUMAN RIGHTS (in the example I gave you above, it is health, but there is education, freedom, traffic, any human right that is violated), and who analyzes those matters?  That's right, magistrates, judges, clerks, clerks, and administrative officers, whom you (I hope you're not) want to eliminate.

Since we understood what the PJF is and what it does, I explain, THE ONLY CURRENT BRAKE ON THE ACTS OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE CHAMBERS OF DEPUTIES AND SENATORS, is the PJF. 

In the example I gave you above, of which the health service is canceled to ALL, it is precisely the PJF before whom you could challenge a situation like this; if you look, the president and congress agree to take away your health service, BUT there is a possible brake, which is the PJF.

Now, the issue of reform; Judges and magistrates, as well as secretaries, clerks and administrative officers, are currently elected with the approval of aptitude and excellence exams; that is, out of 100 the best 10 (to give an example) grab.

The reform seeks to eliminate that system and to be by POPULAR VOTE; That's how it is, like the president, deputies and senators (that is, if you're poor, but you're popular, you're left). That also means that now in PJF there will be political parties; politicized the PJF. And you will say ï¿1/2s ï¿1/2ï¿1/2yyyyyy? As my president said ""how does it affect me?"", let them strike if they want

Well, if the issue of the elimination of social security is resolved by a judge of Morena, or simply without capacity or less OLVï¿1/2DATE, really, friend, OLVï¿1/2DATE, that they give the president of the republic the counter will be 3 powers that will not be contradicted and, therefore,  your human rights problems will matter to you and your mother, because the PJF DOES NOT?

That's why you read that the president is looking for a dictatorship, because, aha, it will continue to be a country with ""23 powers,"" but clearly those 3 powers will be aligned with 1 man ""capichi?""

In short, the reform will only make Morena have no one to stop its acts; And that is the reason for his constant attacks against PJFï¿1/2 but people DO NOT KNOW, and the worst of the case is, THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN KNOWING.

Hence, we cannot see this reform as affecting only PJF workers; but in general, because friend, it's going to touch you, sooner or later this will reach you with unconstitutional taxes that NO ONE will say they are; with the lack of medicines for your cancer treatment or that of your family member; with the removal of your house because there will be a shopping mall, etc. and I hope that when that happens, you remember what you are reading.

Eeeeeen anyway, I hope you read everything; If you did, congratulations, you are no longer ignorant and now you can comment for or against. Greetings (share if you want)."
"The president in the morning giving atole with his finger and in the afternoon in the mouths of all the chairos, let him put schools already lost."
Please touch on the issue of private property
That more than one day there was already a good deal of corruption in the judiciary
"Well, payments and corruption were reformed. Haora will be chosen by making known their knowledge and a qualification that the people will have"
What happened to all those who were previously there how much they earned how many benefits they had and were corrupt
"Something has to be done. If it doesn't work, it is changed. What we have right now clearly does not work. An example is the minimum wage. In the past, it was alleged that raising it would affect production, that there would be inflation, that the bosses would see their finances reduced, and 100 other things. Fortunately it was not like that, domestic consumption skyrocketed and we all win. We must not rush to failure, let's give it a chance. Remember that always doing the same thing and expecting different results is crazy. Greetings band."
"Neither judges nor magistrates are elected by slates. Those are the 11 Ministers, and only them.

Judges and magistrates reach this position through the accreditation of courses and exams, as well as years of experience and dedication to the judicial career."
"We as Mexicans, we don't care what you think or not,,, and it's not all money for the president, he's helping the people"
"Well, knowing what happens with Mexican politics, the most likely thing is that corruption will get worse, I hope I'm wrong"
"The problem is that people often do ""bOtO mACibO!! 1!"" And he will vote for those who align themselves with that party.

It was already worth Mexico, we went from Guatemala to Guatemala."
"Welfare seals and pets are more than those of us who asked for a better country, not even px"
"Yes, I am very concerned because if there is no counterweight it can always give abuses"
The country is going to go down with this reform
Everything was going well until you said that you think it's okay that there are 9 ministers like in the US. The Mexican governmental and legal structure cannot be equated with other types of governmental and legal systems such as that of the United States that handles common law.
In the United States we vote for judges!!  The reform is nothing different from what we have in Nevada.  Mexico is waking up! You can invest your money here for 2% a year instead of Mexico 12% hahaha
"Judicial reform can be good if we see it from the point of impartiality.
The face of concern of those who have shady interests is more than palpable, it was said that the magistrates were independent but clearly it was never like that, they only issued justice for those who had the means to pay for it.
Give life pensions just for being magistrates? An ordinary citizen has to survive on his immunity and if it runs out of money, then why should a few have to be supported for life?
Being elected by the citizens should fall on their achievements in matters of justice, we have seen that even if they have studies they are corrupt to die so the power of studies is not a guarantee of being a good government worker"
The idea is that they are dispensing justice and not for an economic remuneration of half a million per month and dozens of millionaire benefits
"I don't have that much faith in the president, president-elect and Morena party in their majority, but I respect that the majority of Mexicans support the president and it is not even up to each one of us to make decisions for the future"
"The future of this country is worrying. With only one party having political power (historically it has been shown to mean that it does not have a counterweight in the balance of power), the prevailing corruption and the dogmatic populism that is almost religious, they are going to send us to call us Mï¿1/2xizuela after a while "
Incorrect the judges and magistrates are not selected by shortlists they are through competitive examinations that are carried out through very strict evaluations in these competitions more than 2000 people participate to cover between 20 and 100 places depending on the available places
"There are several errors. 

First: A minister is not the same as a judge. Currently, ministers are nominated by the president and ratified by the Senate. Judges are elected by competition in the judiciary. 

Two: Dangerous case judges already have security measures in place. Faceless judges have been criticized and canceled in every country that has been enforced because they did not help reduce crime but did increase discretion and violation of procedural rights. 

Three: You left aside a fundamental controversial issue, which is that it restricts the scope of the amparo. It will no longer accept provisional suspension or collective injunctions. Each person affected by an act of government, for example, a work, must seek their individual protection even when it affects their entire population and the judge may not request that the works be suspended while the merits of the amparo are resolved. That is, the government will continue to do what causes the petition for amparo until the sentence is resolved and by then it may be too late.

Four: the popular election has as a filter the candidacies that will be selected in 2/3 by Morena politicians. That is, the entire judiciary, regardless of the vote, will be loyal to the party. How do we expect fairness and neutrality? Therein lies the heart of the uncertainty it generates, since most of the trials are: commercial and civil. The criminal is the minority."
"They are going to leave us more money, they are not going to spend so much cm before, which came from all the Mexican people"
"To match the salary of someone who has a whole career and several master's degrees and doctorates, to a poor devil who took 14 years to graduate, for example, or to another who has a simple bachelor's degree? No, well, wow."
"Now I understand why the dollar went up. 
That of seeking more profit in addition to his salary anyway was already done by the magistrates. What I do know is that if you are going to be elected by vote, you meet specific requirements to apply."
"In my opinion, this reform should be proven since being equally independent there is corruption and in my opinion other countries should not intervene in internal affairs"
"I remember when they said about the scholarships of the ""ninisï¿1/2"", support for the elderly, etc. They said it was a waste of money and now even Walmart accepts and even gives promotions if you carry your welfare card. The great rats and the beneficiaries were always the usual. Today the support is something notorious and abundant that has helped. Canada is going through a bad patch, the United States is not going to say it, but Mexico has not worn out so much, it is the advantage of not being indebted to the IMF, whatever they say, Mexico is going strong. The United States will always say that Mexico is doing badly when it doesn't suit them because EPN was even rewarded by Forbes. Enough of being the backyard of Europeans and gringos. Mexico needs sovereignty and patriotism, not just on September 15 and 16"
"I would prefer a reform on the contrary.... that deputies and senators be independent without assignment to political parties, that there are greater criteria of merit and education to be eligible, that there is a process of accountability with transparency to the public and a clear mechanism to remove the immunity in cases of corruption, etc. For the judiciary, if there are improvements that could be tried to be implemented, but a reform to change everything at once is very dangerous, something gradual would be better. Anyway, let's see how it goes; while one tries to improve what is within one's reach."
"There is more political and economic certainty, the dollar has also risen due to interest rates, the elections in the USA, the report of high unemployment in the USA, it will have to be mentioned if you are going to talk about the Exchange Rate"
"Hey Luis, how do I invest in cetes?"
"Clear to me, of the 38 years that I have been alive, this has been the best leadership in the country and everything they have done has coercion, absolutely everything, no one after so long had done so much for our country, little paper speaks ???? Labor reform, judicial reform is the best thing that has happened to the country, no one can earn more than the president of the Republic, as our law says, no country has the right to have an opinion in the democratic actions of our country, we are free and sovereign, it is enough that the judges and magistrates are making themselves a fool of themselves, they die the lady that they are free and sovereign. I bet he doesn't even know where Veracruz Island is, then then the one who knows realizes that it is the same cat but rolled over as xochil"
"Sad, but each town has the government it deserves. Mexico has insisted on deserving this socialist government, to its own detriment. God grant that the next six-year term passes soon and with as little damage as possible, and then a good government will come (probably after Mexicans realize how incredibly sad and dangerous their decision to put progressive politicians in government). No matter what party it is, then, what matters right now is doing what is necessary to get rid of the left, socialist and progressive."
"The good thing is that the hierarchy of judges is going to end, who apparently are all either family or are the cousin or friend of another, I hope that all this movement is in favor of the country, of society and above all of Mexico?"
"Well, it seems that you did not see all the Forums on judicial reform, I invite you to watch them, because that is where all the doubts you have in this video were explained. 

In principle, it is not that only those who obtain 8 qualifications will be chosen, obviously the call asks for the minimum, but the best will be chosen according to the CV they present, in fact those who are already judges automatically pass that process. Now in the case of SCJ ministers, he also considers that there will be proposals for each branch, 2 from the executive, 2 from the legislative and 2 from the judiciary. It is not that they are affiliated with a political party, or that it is the most popular who are going to win, since they are not even going to campaign as such, the obligation is that their profiles (CVs) must be disseminated. Because as established before, in order to be candidates they first had to pass the requirement of being the best candidates based on their academic studies, experience and letters of recommendation. Because if anything has been demonstrated, it is that there is nothing more false than to claim that someone who has a lot of knowledge guarantees that there is justice, because if it were so, there would not be the problem of injustice in Mexico and the idea of a Reform would not even have been raised. 

Rather than choosing a judge because he is popular, what is sought is that they are also honest people and who have a vocation to be a public servant. Therefore, what you say about the salary, well, it will never make sense to you, because there are people who really like our work and if it also helps people, it is more than laudable, it is an honor to do it and you do not necessarily do that to recover what you invested in studies, you do it to contribute to the country,  to your birth. But I know that there are people who just don't understand that part and even less that there are people who are willing to do it. It is clear to me when I took my oath at the time of graduation, my duty to have studied in a public institution obliges me to return and contribute knowledge to my country to my society, since I know that in effect thanks to the taxes of many people I had the possibility of having access to higher and postgraduate education. I know that the effort and sleepless nights were my own, but I would not have been able to study because I did not have the resources to pay for a degree and much less a postgraduate degree. 
  
Of the rest, I understand your point, the most important thing is that we all have to inform ourselves about everything when the secondary laws and the selection process come out. It is our civic obligation. 
Greetings and today more than ever ï¿1/2Viva Mï¿1/2xico!"
"It is good that the judiciary already has changes, because the truth is that they were already going over and apart from the salary and benefits very exaggerated!!"
"The controversy of this reform is artificial, only those who are directly related or by a family member are against the reform, the vast majority of Mexicans who have needed their services know that they are currently disgusting"
"I am against it, but what worries me is what its approval represents, as you mention, to see the power that Morena already has today by having a majority in Deputies, Senators and State Commissions, because it is extremely easy for them to make institutions that simply do not agree with their ideals disappear."
I think it is very good that they have approved it. More democracy in an opaque and corrupt power. The finances of Mexicans will prosper more.
What is going to happen is very positive and very clear why there will no longer be corruption and covers for the PRI members who have bought so much judges have bought their impunity
"For me, the reform of the judiciary is good, your livelihood is as a business plan it is good. There are two types of investors, those who go the way of the law, and the other who look for shortcuts to get what they want."
"it is not 2 months old.... since February they took her out...
It's also not clear to me how they're going to choose them... but I think we have to take the first step and as we go... otherwise, nothing will ever be done...
The salary of the magistrates is enough for them.... they can make investments with the teachings that Luismi Negocios gives us and I assure you that when they leave their position they have money to live comfortably."
"Judges are not selected by the president, they and the magistrates access the position through the judicial career and competitive examinations, that is, different requirements and exams, both theoretical and oral, that they have to present, those who access the position through the appointment of the president and ratification of the senate, are only the ministers of the Supreme Court."
"I agree that the presidential salary should be increased, and if it fails us, there will be the revocation of the mandate after 3 years..."
"The reform is going!! 
Investments will be increased!!"
"Friend, DO NOT B0RR comments that differ from your OPINION, if you think you are right, DEFEND it !!!!"
How will it affect us and how it will benefit us???
In favour!
Today the people won 
"Good analysis without being a lawyer and good comments, I find it objective and impartial"
"The deputies and senators, presidents, governors, are elected by the people and are corrupt"
"Well, every change for the better in countries entails sacrifice. History proves it."
AS A MEXICAN YOUR CRITICISM IS ACCEPTED BUT I AM TOO OLD TO HAVE SEEN AND KNOW THAT THE REFORM IS THE BEST YYY WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES THINK IT DOES NOT MATTER OR YOU WANT YOUR NEIGHBOR TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR FAMILY IS LIVED WITH SUCCESSES AND MISTAKES
"Luis, the current ministers boast of having doctorates from Harvard and the justice system is in tatters and not to mention the corruption that prevails in the country"
"To an ass pay 1 million a month to a judge! They are always going to be corrupted, nothing is satisfied with what they have and they always want more."
"Was it an independent body before the reform?? Were they fully trained or independent of external agents? Ken Salazar?? Weren't they already politicized? Wasn't there a meeting between Norma Piï¿1/2a and Alito, a dinner? Greetings and with great respect I leave these comments here."
"Before other parties did what they wanted with the law for their own benefit or that of other people and there was not so much show, neither E.U and Canada said anything"
"Today there are judges and they don't do it all by fart .
And only family and close friends have been occupying that position.

Ya chole, we have to change surnames,
It seems that they are dynasties."
It's not that much money hahahaha.... Do not stain if most of them earn 1800 to 3000 pesos..... Don't mess around
I wouldn't know anything about life if I wasn't subscribed to this channel
"In that case, it will not also be an economic movement organized by business groups in the United States? Remembering history, it has been proven that our neighbors always make economic or military moves to maintain their global economic power at the expense of underdeveloped countries
I believe that we should recreate diverse industries and reduce dependence on imports"
"I also think about that uncertainty. We are about to transform the country 100 or go to the managerial and non-stop fall. In the wrong hands, the country thundered in 5-8 years. Argentinian type :-/"
"WELL, AS A MEXICAN LIVING ABROAD, WITH OR WITHOUT REFORM, LET ME TELL YOU CLEARLY ""WE ARE SHIT"" "
"But they are public servants if they studied in Giricuicho, then let them stay and work in Giricuicho.   l"
Congratulations!. Now to take out the money invested in new Cuba
"It affects us because no one is going to vote for the judiciary, no one will take the time to meet so many for whom we are supposedly going to vote and because now the judges may be anonymous, you will not even find out who it was who left any case unpunished and more if it has to do with narco-politicians"
The division of powers will disappear along with democracy
"If friend and if they leave, who will affect you the most? The poorest are those who applaud everything the government says."
"The cherry tree of beaches of Catazajï¿1/2 Chiapas do not even earn that, for the same reason that they think is happening."
"Hearing wrong statements on this subject by Luis as if they were true, now makes me question his financial and investment knowledge, which I thought was reliable. What a shame because I thought it was well informed... Before the reform, only the ministers of the Court were chosen by the President, not all federal judges and magistrates as falsely stated in this video."
But who is convenient or not that is what matters
"Well, at the moment that inflation begins to increase and my money is worth less I am against it, if you see an improvement over time I will be in favor, although there is a lot of uncertainty, as long as they do not say after a while that private companies are going to be expropriated, which was what happened in Venezuela,  You have to have faith"
"Compadre, the one who wants to work and do good to his country many times does not even receive a salary, you believe that our heroes like Zapata, Villa, Juarez, Morelos gave them a super salary to be the ones who will represent millions of Mexicans in the movements of transformation. You turn little pay why do you only think about money like the current judges that is my comment Luis mi"
"Error! Currently, the President only presents a list of three candidates chosen by the Senate for magistrates of the SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE NATION (11 PEOPLE). The rest of the judges and magistrates (more than a thousand people) are chosen by competitive examination, they have to study and compete through exams. Please don't contribute to misinformation, you didn't mention the current career service at all."
"A change is needed, and we will see if it is good or bad until now Mexico is better economically they no longer steal only a few as before they look at investments."
"Less investment, less employment, less economic growth, more corruption, on the way to Venezuela"
There are 42 thousand because they are all the judicial powers
"What they are talking about is the wake-up call from other countries that clearly have a better economy. And stability. Not the best in the world. But it is better than our country. 
And that our president, well, ignore them, and momentarily cut off relations. Which can be drastically harmful."
"Question, why when the dollar fell to 16 prices did not fall or inflation drop? However, when the dollar rises, again, prices rise again"
"Is it clear, Miluis? Is it clear that you say that because of the studies at Jarvar and Princeton? He points out that ""judge"" has studies in those schools. Please."
I am in favor of more meritocracy and less nepotism
"They are affected by those officials who have their relatives in the mine.  Only in tampamolon in the presidency are there siblings, mothers, fathers, and four in the family in the presidency. And there is no nepotism. Now we go to court, there are friends, compadres who spent time on the street in their university days and are in the best positions"
"When you talk about the new talk about the old too, you can't tell me that there is no corruption and nepotism in the current judiciary and that thanks to that they are a marvel of power "
"I agree that their salary should be lowered, they will be carrying an extremely important position for the country, it is a position that has been carried out of honor and love for the nation and not the love of money. If they have graduate studies at Harvard, good for them, but if the interest is in making money a public position is not the key."
"I think that the only thing that does not seem fair to me is the saying of rich government, poor people, since only a few benefit and if it were not for the labor force there would not be such power which we already are."
"I believe that a judicial reform is necessary since currently it is clear that judges are not independent and in many cases not fair either. The question is whether this is the ideal reform. I don't think so, surely there will be things to improve and correct. We will see how it works and I hope that in case something does not work we can as a country make the necessary changes."
"Well, with that the Judiciary only resolved 1% of the cases, I think a change was needed. Let's hope it works."
"Well I agree with some points, but the inflation of the United States of 2.53, that is the great lie of the century, I live in both countries and I can tell you that many things in the United States went up almost double, a taco went from 1.50 in some places to 7 dollars with an average of 3.50 per taco. The rent went up a lot, and so many other things. Yes, I saw that things went up in Mexico but compared to the United States, it is not true. There if they went up too much."
"Because no matter how prepared the judges are, they are not being effective, so go ahead with their salary reduction."
"In short, we have already messed up."
"It is very little for you, ordinary people earn much less with that, it is more than enough 120 thousand"
"It's good that they earn that.
There must be the power who is willing to be a true leader, what they earn is more than enough to be able to live.
If a little salary of 50 thousand pesos is enough, what is not enough for them with what they earn..."
"It is better not to play the investor in MORENATO. It is not a threat, it is a warning."
Pffff !! Justifying corruption
"Just as an observation, judges are not chosen by the president, they carry out a selection process through competitive examinations"
It's just that almost none of the next judges will come out of Harvard or Princeton... Perhaps you will come out of some duckling university or the university of the same or worse malaise than bad... 
"I am against it.
Because no, we are interested in politics since we do not investigate candidates. That they are no more than 6 think we will do it with 300"
"The government was always in control of everything, they did what they wanted and no country said anything, not even the UN, and the neighbors to the north were happy, and anyway the day continued to rise, inflation continued, corruption etc."
The political parties will now have their ranks full
"If they don't accept because the money isn't enough, they may not be qualified for the position."
That I cut their salaries totally in agreement
"Luis, Thank you very much for everything you share, greetings"
"I have a doubt, about investments in dollars, right now that it is at a higher exchange rate is a good time to diversify? My bank opened this type of investment but right now I don't know if it's a good idea. Thank you."
"Well, of course they have to comply with the Requirements 
This guy is or is made"
And not so much for the rites.... What merits? Be a family member of someone important??????? .... like why he came up with the idea of making a YouTube channel???
And peï¿1/2a in how he left us....
Why don't they put a difficult exam and the best ones stay?
"All good, but the investment in Mexico was fine, by the way I don't buy a dollar, it is convenient"
"It was already worked in the convenient way for the judges and it could not be improved, in any job when you do not take care of the privileges that the company gives you, it takes them away from you"
"When Prian was there they also had a majority in the Senate and they also passed many reforms to the constitution and you don't say anything about that, for example the pensions where they screwed us with the retirements."
I know that the leftists are tired of seeing in the name of Venezuela... But you've seen the video of Maduro congratulating Mexico on the reform and saying it's also an achievement of Venezuelans???
"It does not say where these judges are going to get from, whether they are going to have studies or not"
"Justice which only the one who can pay
And the one who doesn't, even if he is innocent, stays locked up so that we become idiots"
"Raise your hands to those here who have read the judicial reform in detail, not even the producer of this video has done so. Do not speculate about something you do not know, please. A hug."
"If they don't like their job, they should look for another one and that's it"
"They talk as if the judicial system in Mexico works, but no, it is very rotten, it is like saying that you should not buy a new car because we already have a very old and super defective one."
In favour 
"In favour! Little by little, Mexico is gaining more ground against the corrupt system that has paused progress and a better economy! Why do you think there are so many foreigners now living in Mexico? And those who come!  It is an excellent country that is developing, Every change is good and this will be another success of the current government!"
This guy how do I see this... Obviously against such absurd salaries and thousands of people in misery and with pensions that with a pension is more than the minimum salary of 1000 people is absurd.
"I liked the comments... but I still believe that officials should definitely not earn more than 200 thousand, let's remember that it is not how much you earn but what you are capable of doing with it, most officials squander and misuse our resources."
I have already given the title of commander to a lady who should be the president
"Well, something tells me that the country is going to continue screwed up as always no matter who chooses the judges."
Let the corrupt worry
"Do you really think they were there on merit before?  That was a good joke, even with merits and everything there are cases of corruption and negligence "
"120 thousand pesos a month is little? Perhaps, but there they must be out of vocation, not to get rich"
In theory the reform is incredible but in practice everything is going to rot more
"If judges were to campaign politics to run for office, it would cause me to fear the populist issue. I agree that it is something that cannot be measured until it happens, now: if Morena can make reforms, then go ahead, as long as it is not a Fobraproa, remove zeros from the peso to hide a depreciation of more than 500%, millionaire fences and all kinds of stupidities ahead."
"No bad reports, only those who study law apply"
"There is still discussion and debate to be had on the secondary laws, that's where the details come in"
"I think the salary you don't agree with! For them it is a tip. I don't think they only have that income.
In addition to the fact that he studied so much in international universities, what good is it to the people of Mexico? According to what they say and accept, 98% of crimes are not punished! And they are eminences. So we earned the same"
"Being an ordinary citizen, without resources to invest, I will have to look for more means to survive. I am honest and will work more, maybe I will put a craving stall to increase my income a little more but I worry about those who are not honest. Those who are not honest are going to look for connections with crime and crime is going to increase. The judicial system is not going to be enough because if it is already corrupt, corruption will also grow. An infernal chain."
"Well, I think that the old reliable is not reliable. We need something new.."
"Not everything in life is money Luis, those who work in the government are so as not to get rich, you should understand that by now..."
"Of course, that the president earns that amount, no one believes it."
"With the salaries that are going to be cut, universities can be opened and we will have greater opportunities. Young millions of Mexicans are left without the opportunity to study due to the lack of universities in Mexico"
? LONG LIVE AMLO GENIUS OF POLITICS ? HUMANIST HONORABLE HONEST INCORRUPTIBLE ? WHO SAVED THE PEOPLE? AND DEFEATED? TO THE PSYCHOPATHIC PREDATORY FACHOS ? THIEVES? Inhumans and bread
"For me, let them do what they want.
Reform is useless if there is corruption all over the country.
To my nothing, give me a job and that's it,
No one can get me out of poverty. Just me. Breaking my mother at work."
"Nobody is perfect, and that's the problem if MORENA makes a mistake now if it will hurt the country too much and all because of the fault of the majority of the people who voted for the same party for all the nominations"
"You made a drastic mistake at minute 1:19, magistrates and judges are not selected by the president and ratified by the senate, that only happens in the case of ministers, judges and magistrates come to office through the judicial career, that is, they have to have about 8 years of judicial career,  starting from the lowest position and then competing to access the position of Judge or Magistrate, that is, now in the new system the most prepared will no longer arrive, but the most popular."
"An apology, like the hell we are going to know the judges and magistrates "
"The same old thing is going to happen, they are going to screw us with their tricks, whoever is in power."
Another who had to leave poor will be left without pension and privileges a support for the youtuber 
"It is difficult to know if it is good or bad, because we already know that votes are not audited, it takes a lot of effort and risk to see that the ""winning"" votes are really winning votes.
    On the other hand, it is pleasant to know that whoever is in power will not have it easy to put his useless and avaricious compadre in power, however we return to the same thing, CORRUPTION."
"To be honest, no one in their right mind would choose a judge because of his pretty face or his charisma, personally I would vote for his knowledge and experience! on the other hand, we have to continue paying attention to U.S. businessmen or the gringo government, if they are guaranteed the rule of law, we are no longer in the Porfiriato! we are already an important country for the United States itself, we give our worth!"
"Give a serious review to the channel of the colonel and the professor, there you will understand where the new reform will be directed"
"I just do....
ANYONE!!!
I would have governed well, this would never have happened "
"The problem is that the common people do not have the knowledge to be able to make an election for those positions and they will vote for orange blossom, if they do not investigate who they vote for for legislators and even for president less for so many positions"
"The president earns $130,000 a month and a common worker $290 pesos a day seems to me that he could still earn less"
From populism to socialism and then to communism and then to no sï¿1/2 k that they said 6 years ago we no longer want the finger without studies ... such as the reform of the education of Peï¿1/2a Nieto ... Education is also an institution and only the teachers repaired as in this name the K work there in the courts. When the PRIAN won.. fine thank you.. Now that's what the people want
"But the president's salary is not only the amount you say, WITH WHAT DO YOU THINK HE PAYS FOR HIS STAY IN THE PALACE, HIS FOOD, CARS, SECURITY, CELL PHONES ETCï¿1/2ETCï¿1/2ETCï¿1/2ETCï¿1/2ETCï¿1/2."
"It is totally harmful, from now to May 2025 the transition will be and things will be half calm"
"Personally, having great inequality in Mexico due to corruption and several factors such as poorly distributed wealth and few opportunities, gave way to propose another model of government more leftist, now let's see how it works, since the previous models are only consequences of what is experienced today."
"1 If the UEBLO gave the vote to Morena, I don't understand why we continue to rejegos, that's just how the people vote."
Anonymity for judges for their safety 
"Enjoy what you voted. Thank you to all those who voted for Morena.
We have a rather uncertain future"
"And why will it affect???. That we were no more affected by blatant corruption that because of stupidity and because they gave them money underwater, they let the big Rattas go free??? I wonder if it will affect me???"
"This compa is disgusting, defending the excessive salaries of these public officials. In Mexico there is a large population with master's and doctoral studies, and they would like to earn salaries of 100 thousand a month. Many are unemployed."
"I am in favor, if these reforms will benefit us, in theory foreign banks, such as BBVA, HSBC, BANCO SANTANDER I DON'T REMEMBER THE OTHER BANK THAT IS MERGED WITH THE NATIONAL BANK OF MEXICO BANAMEX, LEAVE MEXICO, INCLUDING BANCOPPEL AND BANCO AZTECA DISAPPEAR"
"@luis Mi Negocios, your comment on what judges should earn, is about the same issue of politics and not about the financial analysis of the public administration, did you say that it should be like all Mexicans, because the issue of its payment does not fall into that section of like all Mexicans? "
The poor as always will resent
"Objectively as there is NO precedent for this in history, any prediction of what will happen is directly speculation.

Ps: given the context of Mexico I do NOT agree with high salaries, until the population equalizes their salary to that of the US or Switzerland
The peso should be backed by silver, oil and lithium NOT by financial markets"
"I just remind you that the new president, of the salary he pursues, does not spend a single peso, from his purse and the judges pay all taxes and fines and all services like every citizen"
"Affect! I sound like a pack, how it will improve! That is the question, there will no longer be money to buy from judges and those who do buy the boat, it will be difficult for the narco to buy the law"
I just know it's going to affect those who are stealing now
"Well, simple we are already screwed with the corrupt and inefficient and above all expensive system of the judges, making any change is profit compared to how they have us"
"8 on average??? I understand that doctors are always asked to have an average of 10, I imagine because they are dealing with life. Here it is the same and an average of 8 is insufficient, because now anyone can buy a degree in law and now they will even be able to be a judge???
Now sadly we have seen that the wise people are not wise enough to elect by vote."
"To me you sound like all those who are against AMLO. Everything bad you stipulate is exactly what we have already had since the PRI has been in power. Haven't you seen what happens on Saturdays? Why do we want a judge with so much study in universities if in any case money and power were never enough for them and therefore they were at the service of the highest bidder. If that's what they learn at Harvard, I prefer a thousand times someone with less education but who does punish the people who abuse with lebosia and advantage against the weak or the defenseless. I also prefer someone to come from poor and humble roots so that they know what it is like to be robbed and left with nothing so that they can have humane compassion for the people and understand that other countries always want to plunder us and can stop them with the authority that WE THE PEOPLE grant them. I am a nationalist from my country Mexico and I support the 4th transformation. Thank you to all who read my message and agree."
Let's go to Venezuela ?? 
Norma Piï¿1/2a was the worst evaluated and she herself has confessed that those who put there are by hand look at her interview they do with her.
"Luismi, you comment that it is all the power in a single party, at this time Morena, and exactly in a single party, as it always was with the PRI in collusion with the PAN. 
And with this reform of the judiciary it is perfect and we are going to see how it works and if it is by popular election then obviously people who are not with the profile of the position that is going to be required are not going to be candidates, it is like in a company you are not going to be putting anyone as general manager. It has and must have the job profile. Let's see how this reform of the judiciary is progressing."
"But they want to win the million. It is not fair because it is the money of Mexicans that they are paid, and money that should be spent on Mexicans. In the people who are the ones who pay. Improve health, education, infrastructure. If they want to earn that, they should go to the private sector. A salary of 120 thousand pesos is 1 million a year or is very good. And it is even high. The majority of Mexicans earn 5,000 a month. It is rude not to help those who are most needed."
"To say that Morena has the power to change Whatever it wants, just to say,
I mean that Morena can change it, but it has shown that it has changed them for the benefit of the people,
Not like the reform of electricity or education, which the PRI members approved and have done a lot of damage to the country"
"Okay, inflation for the dollar costs more, in the stage of the strong peso against the dollar never went down a single price"
At min 3:49 I don't give you the reason!!! I know that they lower their salaries. With that they can live excellent.. or have another option!! That they raise their salaries as they do every six-year term!! 8 pesitos like they did to all Mexicans!!!
It is to put in the judiciary those elected by Morena and have absolute power.
"It is wrong to say that the president selects judges in the current system,... Only the ministers, 3 are proposed and the senate chooses 1"
Informed Mexicans will never be defeated
"The reform of the judiciary in my country is necessary, there are ministers who have more than 40 families working in the offices of the judiciary and other institutions, there are some who earn more than 400 thousand pesos a month thanks to the diversion of public funds that they authorize themselves,  there is a minister whose two daughters appear in the DPJ mine and earns more than 100 thousand pesos a month, they live off the public radio that millions of Mexicans pay for and surprise they only showed up once to work ï¿1/2. The judiciary in Mexico is almost a monopoly controlled by cronies, sponsored persons and relatives as well as one of the most corrupt in Latin America, there are people who have not been prosecuted who lead to more than 90% of unsolved cases, people who for more than 90% of cases of corruption, tax evasion,  etc have been acquitted, people whose bank accounts are unfrozen among other evils, resulting in justice being in charge of the one who has the most regardless of the crimes he has. 
A reform of the Judiciary in Mexico is more than necessary and fair, in order to gradually access a rule of law, in which every citizen has the right to be and feel represented before the law regardless of his socio-economic indolence."
"I am Mexican and I know well what the federal justice system is like in Mexico, unfortunately the federal judiciary is managed by 65 families including ministers, magistrates, and judges, and the federal judiciary is at the service of the wealthiest, and if you don't believe, RICARDO SALINAS PLIEGO owes the treasury more than twenty-five million pesos in taxes to the federation,  But since the federal judiciary granted him a federal injunction not to pay, then this man says he is not going to pay."
"It is wrong that it does not affect the local judicial powers, because when the reform is implemented, they will have to adapt to the federal model"
"Error in 2:50, he does not propose that they have a lower salary than the president, that is already in the Constitution. The judges pass that through the arch of triumph. What is intended is that what is already there is made effective."
"That sound in the background does not allow us to hear, it is horrifying."
"Other key points are that the Judiciary has been politicized for decades, 60% of the workers are family members or acquaintances and with such a high percentage of nepotism – is there really a Judicial career?, Many there are salaries that not even the CEO of a company gets to have and the reform was proposed since February and to date the opposition has not proposed anything."
Privileges are over! Viva Mexico ??
"If justice is already politicized anyway, ask yourself who puts the judges there... depending on what they can do for them"
They earn 25 thousand dollars a month and for 30 years they had blocked the increase to the minimum wage by 80 pesos 4 dollars a day 120 dollars a month the lowest in Latin America
"Those who support the politicization of justice do so because they believe it will favor them, then when the political tide changes they end up learning the hard way."
"And they put the corrupt Marko Cortï¿1/2s in their video, whom not even in their party they want."
"It's good what Mexico does, congratulations Mexicans are an example of the world"
"And it was called Democracy, Greetings from Venezuela ??"
"There is a lot of money that many corrupt people steal, let's hope that some of that changes with this."
"Justice has always had a party, but they hid it, now we will know to which party they belong, the exam for federal judges was a formality because they were always appointed by hand."
ONLY THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN MEXICO FOREVER KNOW HOW NECESSARY THIS REFORM WAS??
"But that would basically lead to the judiciary being controlled by the ruling party, it is never, ever a good idea to allow the concentration of power. The separation of powers exists so that they can counterbalance each other and watch each other."
"The perfect dictatorship never went away, it evolved."
"For days there is no justice, drastic changes are needed"
"If one thing is clear, it is that history taught us that man learns nothing from it. It seems that societies need to hit rock bottom to finish learning from their mistakes; sometimes at a very high price. This reform is one of those crossroads where, depending on the route taken, it can lead us to a great disaster. That changes need to be made? Of course, yes, a reform is required, surely, but what is the regulatory body? Who evaluated the competencies and capacities of these magistrates? Of those who are going to impart justice? Only with a popular election? Are the people prepared and sufficiently informed to discern whom to elect as magistrates? On the other hand, it is the risk that a political tendency; Whatever it may be, it can monopolize control of the Supreme Court; see the case of what is happening today in Venezuela ?? For at least 20 years since the application of what is now called ""Reform of the Judiciary"" this is a Pandora's box from which we do not know what may come out of it. Undoubtedly, changes must be made after what Mexican history has taught us over time, but for a fair and impartial reform a national consultation with all the sectors involved is necessary since it is in the public interest and concerns us all for the defense of democracy. God bless and protect Mexico ??"
"As you say, it seems beneficial for Mexico, what you are not saying is that Morena has manipulated the votes, that they have so many key people on the payroll, current magistrates, among others. What MLO is doing is ensuring that he can change Mexico's Constitution at will. In order for such important bodies to be submitted to popular vote, they first have to guarantee that whoever counts the votes and regulates the vote is an independent and impartial entity, and currently belongs to the Morena payroll."
"How many of you have any idea what the name of the deputy you voted for is? Exactly. They voted for the logo. REFORM IS URGENT, but not this. Bolivia and us, REALLY? I feel sorry for the poor who will not be able to contribute to the campaigns of judges."
"I am Mexican and this reform was the straw that broke the camel's back for me to see the possibility of emigrating to another country in a few years. Even though I am young and without a university degree, I consider myself a very well-informed person, since the vast majority of my family works in the public sector and we have seen with our own eyes that since AMLO came to power he began to enact a series of laws and reforms that violated the constitution.  There is more poverty now than in previous administrations.

And now with this reform of the judicial system we are closer to ending up like countries like Venezuela and Cuba, the people outside the politics who are in favor of this reform do not take into account the corruption that exists in the prosecutors' offices and public ministries, as well as the corruption of the president,  his family, friends and members and allies of his party who do not stop clinging to political power.

Anyway, after everything when I leave Mexico, I will miss a lot of the culture, food, beautiful beaches and climate of many regions of my country."
Very superficial his report!
"Gimme tha power, it is of basic level to know why powers are divided and now they have concentrated them in the executive, that has a name."
"I didn't like the background music.
You are not heard well."
That is what a legacy. It has left destruction. Violence and more misery.
"time will tell if this is a good or bad or decision, what I do not think is that the evaluation to which the candidates for judges were subjected is eliminated... Moreover, these evaluations should be prior for all candidates, so that only qualified people will be in positions of power, and not incompetent politicians who have no idea what they should do in their positions or do not even have a decent level of education"
And the ministers of the MP for when? You go to ask for justice and after 7 years they open a file
"They accept that reform is necessary but no, they had years to propose the reform that they consider necessary and they did not do it. They say that with this reform the judiciary will be at the service of the party in government when we all know that this has always been the case, the president and legislators of the PRI and the PAN put their judges when they were a majority. They say that MORENA uses its majority to ""impose"" its reforms when they have always done it that way; If the majorities support you, it is so that you can decide the path that the country should follow, the neoliberals did it for decades until the majority of the people said enough, that is democracy."
"If they already vote badly for their deputies and presidents, what makes them think that they will be able to vote judges responsibly?"
"Our government has no idea how much people are suffering these days. I feel sorry for disabled people who don't get the help they deserve. Thank you Petra Roberts, imagine investing $1000 and receiving $4000 in 3 days."
I explain them in a very simple way to those who are not from Mexico: What the party in power (Morena) wants is to have control of the three powers and get rid of ALL the checks and balances in order to perpetuate itself in power as the PRI (another party in Mexico) did for 70 years.
"36 MILLION MEXICANS VOTE FOR THE REFORM 
LONG LIVE PLAN C "
"You forgot to comment that the United States opposes the reform arguing that voting for the magistrates is anti-democratic in Mexico because it has judges as a mode, when in their case they vote for their judges as will now be done in Mexico. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that judges release those prosecuted by law at the request of the executive, judges in accordance with their interests, even to the detriment of the population."
"Corruption, impunity, nepotism, abuses and contempt for the constitution have flooded the PJF, ï¿1/2 yes to the reform! "
"We voted for that, we want reforms!"
"Step #1 approval at the federal level being able to provide improvements in secondary laws, step #2 reform state prosecutors"
"Respectfully, VERY VERY VERY superficial your capsule.... Laura."
The music makes it very hard to hear and concentrate. Please consider lowering the volume or just leaving it out completely.
Excellent analysis.
"It is a disgrace what we have experienced in Mexico in this six-year term. Worst of all, many Mexicans agree with the choices of this nefarious president. Education, health, security have gone downhill. 
The truth is that I don't understand how people blindly support him."
Good information
It is cheaper to educate people to make good decisions than to continue supporting the millionaire salaries of judges and magistrates.
"On deaf ears if they do not evaluate them through exams, which demonstrate their qualification."
"Only the shape of the finger will be changed, but it will be the same, I think"
Thank you
"The worst clause, very biased"
Thank you very much for the information. I'd like you to talk a little more about the legislative branch here in Mexico and its change in history.
"Hopefully they will interview Patricia Aguayo, spokesperson for the workers of the judiciary."
"""The scream"" has changed, before it was ""alive"" and now it is also ""death"""
"The permanent Driver's License has more requirements than those who ask to be a Judge, Minister or Magistrate. I wish it were a joke"
"It is absolutely disrespectful of you to refer to the President of Mexico, as AMLO,
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is not your equal.  Whether you like it or not, you owe respect to the highest authority in Mexico, minimize his investiture, speak of your intellectual poverty"
"Many posh people in the demonstrations. This reform is more democracy, welcome to the reform!!"
"Be careful my Mexico, we must be careful with our rulers, we must not believe that all their intentions are positive and for the people"
"In the end it is not like Mexico had the fairest law, the changes are good. And if this really helped to take power away from the corrupt, it would be good."
That's the best thing that could have happened
The music of the video must be lower than the journalist's voice
"It is appreciated that an objective media clearly explains the changes of the judicial reform in Mexico being impartial, I am always watching your videos keep it up"
"It's controversial because
- Doesn't prioritize victims 
-It takes away the rights of workers in the judiciary (we are not talking about high positions but about people who have been working for years and who with a vote will throw them out on the street).
 - Does not pay in the prevention of crime 
 - It does not guarantee an end to arbitrary detentions, which are the daily bread (as the false positives in Colombia were, or perhaps continue to be; only that here they are not always murdered, but locked up in prison with or without trials full of faults and errors).
I wish they would delve deeper into it because giving all the power to an asshole is of no use to anyone but him or her or his close ones.

???"
"I don't know if it is the right reform, but at least the judiciary that feels so untouchable in the countries of LATAM already knows that citizens have the power to remove them or leave them in their positions, it will be up to each person to vote with conscience and not follow others like sheep,  in Peru there is a political party that is the son of the PRI and has made the judiciary its home and the truth is that we also need a change that gives the citizens the power to remove or leave prosecutors and judges."
"They are going to set an example to the world, as they did with their health system like Denmark "
"I support the opposition for all the times that AMLO insults and intimidates in the mornings. No, it's not the PRI, but that's where it's going."
"I mean
that each of the disciplines was the
purer possible than knowledge
was the purest possible in both
economics and in exact sciences such as
in mathematics but also in law and
then one of the Pillars
How to teach law
in Mexico it is legal positivism"
"That is the extreme left in Mexico.  
No debate and no listening to the protesters."
"In Democracy, the independence and autonomy of the Public Powers, exercised by officials, with prior preparation, apolitical, is the guarantee and balance, for a more Just Society!"
"analysis of political corruption in Chile, a special program, would be very good..."
FULL SUPPORT FOR THE REFORM 
Mexicans love impunity
"Why don't they say that the president gave them the opportunity to do the reform of the judiciary themselves and what did they do? Nothing, they even mocked it."
Neither the PRI nor the PAN gave an opening to the dialogue or to society and now they do want to be heard 
The popular vote that knows the right ? It is enough with congress and civil society grouped in professional associations. At least these last ones will choose the best.
"There has never been judicial independence, the magistrates have always been elected by the power in turn. This note is shallow, biased and lacked a little (much) more research"
With this we enter into the absolute dictature
"Terrible. In countries like ours where corruption is the way of life, with this measure there will be too much impunity because judges, magistrates will side with the candidate who pays them the most."
"What I say is that what is happening right now does not and has not served the people for a long time,
Change is needed, hopefully and that when they vote they are well informed by who they are voting for."
It was already politicized!!
Listening to everyone? And not the people of Mexico?
"Well, almost the entire reform has the information in reserve, for that fact they should have rejected it"
I think maybe Mexico is a separate case with respect to elected judges
"Justice in Mexico, as in almost all countries, is already politicized. At least now it is going to be democratized there. Finally, it is to be expected that the current justice workers will be against this reform because it will leave many without jobs and without privileges."
"This information they give in this video is partial. They say nothing about the corruption of power, the family members who work there, and the processes that favor corporations. We need a change yes or yes "
"Good summary thank you, I believe that this change is necessary because it is releasing criminals, unfreezing accounts, giving protection to criminals and debtors, earning millions of pesos for glasses, meals, the day of the father or mother, to repair their houses etc. etc. So what do they pay with their millionaire salary (nothing!!) plus a millionaire pension for life. In addition there is too much nepotism and much more, these characters are a little gem but no one mentions or investigates this part they only criticize that AMLO is capricious, I think that it was urgent to renew the entire judicial system and little by little adjustments will be made if necessary, this is my point of view in a respectful way"
The judiciary is not independent of the factual powers or the parties in power. The minister president was appointed by Peï¿1/2a Nieto and is at the service of the PRIAN and the potentates.
"I really don't understand it 100%, but from what I've seen it's not so good, starting with the way they imposed it, because that's the word, to impose without paying attention to the workers of the judiciary or the opposition, which is already a bad sign and without taking into account that it can affect the Free Trade Agreement that benefits us or even the human rights in themselves quite trampled upon. I hope that since they were in a hurry to implant it like this, it will be for the benefit of Mexicans, but I doubt it. From there we start off on the wrong foot. God help us"
"I am in full agreement with the passage of this law, a change in the judiciary is needed..."
How sad that this reform is being carried out.
Example of what NOT to do 
"The only ones who oppose it are the privileged caste of the judiciary, the ordinary citizen voted for the deputies and senators to carry out this reform"
"people Look at one of the
Fundamental pillars of education
liberal in Mexico is still the
Legal positivism and positivism
Legally it is basically the version
Juridica of philosophical positivism"
"The comments made in this video imply a certain tendency, because in addition to lacking sufficient exposition of context, it is also conducive to understanding the elements of this reform as negative."
"By popular choice, I like it, so I could largely eliminate corruption in the judicial system"
"Very well forward with the reform,"
The bad thing about the video was the ringtone that is heard more than the journalist's voice
"I like the idea that judges are appointed by popular vote and not by hand, I don't see the problem."
"Having China as a backing, we should be concerned about the free trade agreement, I don't think it is in the interest of the US that we turn to the Asian country..."
"A great step for this wonderful country, thanks to AMLO Mexico has awakened and the people are more aware, 
The judiciary is rotten and needs a root solution,
Many criticize this change, however, none of the other political parties propose anything better than this, 
I fully support the proposed change, and as a society we have to be more attentive, more aware, more aware of the political reality of Mexico or any country, only the truth will make us free"
"They must change the mentality too, it is the country of the ratchet."
The injustice and impunity of the judiciary must stop
"I wish the BBC would do a more in-depth investigation because it is not telling us anything new, everything it says is what we already know, why does it not delve into the exams they must take to aspire to the SCJN? ï¿1/2O the details of the USMCA that the United States is talking about (an interventionist country with terrible flaws in its judicial system)"
Why does the U.S. want to immute itself in a matter that belongs entirely to Mexico?
"Judicial reform is the desire of the majority of Mexicans, that's what a real democracy is like, in fact, chest. There are many fallacies and lies from international and national media. The reform is a great achievement.
All my support for this reform, greetings from Manitoba in Canada ??  and long live Mexico ??."
"It is a mistake to say that it is politicized, it is only democratized, that is, judges are elected by the people. Point 2: they were above the law indiscriminately, they gave amparos, they condoned criminals, and of course they did not earn the millions they had in their hands."
Forward with judicial reform!
The main problem of the administration of justice is the basis of the pyramid.  Judges who depend on municipalities and states.   Reducing salaries will only make the real trained people look for other sources of income.
"The problem is not the judiciary, the prosecutors depend directly on the executive not on the judiciary, that's where a reform needs to be applied because the prosecutors are the ones who don't do their job properly, the judiciary is the only one that is currently prepared to apply the law"
"It didn't help me much, but it made me more curious."
"Not bad! Congratulations to Mexico excellent decision, I am happy !"
"I've already seen Cuauhtï¿1/2moc Blanco and Sergio Mayer as judges, or even ""Gomita"" or ""Bellakath"" (yes, Bellakath is a lawyer and could be the judge who hears your case as soon as you have it...). But they insist that is what they want..."
"Latin Americans care about and are interested in the progress of Mexico, prosperity WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE, NO MORE IMPUNITY FOR CRIMINALS."
I didn't know that the BBC wasn't biased :)
"Very good video. The background music is exasperating and very loud, it does not allow you to hear the information correctly"
"This gives the 3 powers to the dominant party. With the 3 powers, the dominant party can do whatever it wants with this country. It can impose laws to its liking and affect whomever the dominant party wants. He can take away your property overnight, he can nationalize resources or companies, he can impose an eternal president (dictator) if he wants to, I don't know what international company dares to invest in a country with the permanent risk of losing his money at any time. This can affect Mexico's economy for a very long time, and all because of the ambition for more and more power for a single party, or rather, a single man."
I think that's fine overall. But it is not right that judges do not pass an exam now. This is how many Juanitos and relatives will arrive at those positions. :(
"It's good that they change those corrupt judges, Mexico is like this no man's land, only those who have money and those corrupt judges who propagate injustice and disorder in the country... the gossip of those gentlemen who are only families who are in the judicial power of Mexico are over... well Mexico, they are on the right track."
"That the pension is taken away and the expensive monthly salary is vital, hopefully they have learned to save and that the number of magistrates is also reduced, the fact that the people have to elect them based on qualifications and letters of recommendation generates safe traps and new buyers."
"Valla, despite showing more arguments against it, on this occasion, did not take a position."
" A real investigation is needed, they ask those who have served, not those who demand justice!"
*Correction! it does affect the local judicial powers... All state judges will also be elected by popular vote
"The country is over Mexico I really hope that the United States will take us as one more star on its flag, but I think with so many narcos and criminals they will not want us or give us away."
We are already the same as in Venezuela ??
Too good
"In my opinion, it is a mistake for people to get involved in the election of judges. The reform can be done in another way."
"Regarding the comments of the United States and its organizations, I remind them ""respect for the rights of others, it is peace"", their interference is not acceptable and no one gives them the moral quality to decide in our country."
"Video about Mexico
Comments: ultra left

video about Peru
Comments: ultra right."
?????? LONG LIVE JUDICIAL REFORM!!!???????? VIVA MEXICO!!!?????????????? LONG LIVE THE YOUNG!!!??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
"Serious question, what does the reform say about how judges will present themselves, with a party logo or with only a name? I hope not as members of party x or y "
"In what way is the current election of magistrates not ""political""? Systems are not perpetual. There is always a way to outwit them, manipulate them, ""hack"" them. More with the impunity rates that are handled."
"I was surprised, for the worse, by the analysis and exposition of the presenter. What he says is partial, shallow and light arguments. It is far from being a solid information capsule."
"WE HAVE TO GET INTO THIS ISSUE, STUDY, EXPLAIN AND KNOW THE RESUMES OF THE GRADUATES WHO WANT TO APPLY Please let the judges and magistrates get to work or remove them they have been of no use they are very inept, they treat badly, they prolong cases and charge for speeding up procedures GET OUT ALL THOSE LAZY"
"There are biases in this information, those profiled will go through a technical review of knowledge, currently it is decided by influence and not by having passed an exam. AMLO proposes the reform and Mexicans approve it, today for this reason, many who do not want it, recognize the need for the reform, if it was not proposed they would have recognized it?"
How is it that respectable newscasts sound more and more like propaganda
Esto_se_va_a_ poner_feo.JPG
"The background music doesn't allow you to hear well, it's horrible! Fire the editor of the video, it's bad!!"
"3:05 
Mexico has a high level of impunity because most of it falls on the prosecutors and they do their job badly. 
Only 10% of complaints reach judges."
I am Mexican is the best thing that has happened to our country
"Justice is not imparted under democratic criteria, if it were, then decisions in law would be settled by the majority and not by the norm."
It is the same school since the extinction of Luz y Fuerza del Centro. Thinking that it only affects others.
"If you want to find out about the motivations of the reform, watch the program of La Base de CanalRed, because this video is limited to acting as a spokesperson for the employers and businessmen of North America..."
Handing over the judicial system to narco-communism
Now it is bad to have a reform like Switzerland and the United States ??? 
This video does not clarify anything other than the trend or the line that they mark to follow  
That's why I left Mexico because I got tired of so much crap and injustice... Power is crime.
"The worst thing is that looking at it well, this reform does not look bad, but I don't see the sense of the election of judges or how it would be possible for us to vote for those 2000 positions"
In favor of this reform 
There was really no controversy. The vote in the last elections was overwhelmingly in favour.
I got to a minute with twenty of the video and I already had inaccuracies. I didn't go on.
"Furthermore, please see the current moment, after the vote for change, when it will be effective?"
"In simpler words, it will cease to be the criterion for selecting magistrates, judges, ministers, etc., which implies that they violate our right and that any inept person is left in charge of those positions, which causes us not to have an amparo to a law that harms us"
"Popular vote of fear. Before going viral this video and others. People are with other news. In the face of a society like this, what awaits us and with alienated media and manipulating information."
The future looks dark
"Oh, among the topics to be discussed, can you talk about the working conditions of federal public employees? Those who get the job, can

It will be interesting to know what percentage of them are unionized, what proportion have positions of trust and what volume are hired on a temporary basis.

Finally, do you know if outsourcing services have been eradicated among those who provide cleaning services to these institutions?

To indicate that the working conditions of the workers of the judiciary are privileges, it also arises from a place of precariousness of the working conditions of public servants."
"A pity of explanation, without pointing out the excesses of the current judiciary (corruption, nepotism and justice for those who have the most $)"
NO SALARY MUST EXCEED 10 MINIMUM WAGES
"When there is such an overwhelming majority in favor of reform, it is not true that it is controversial. The only ""critical"" are those who have always been favored by nepotism and corruption. I thought the Canal Red video was much better."
"AMLO's best speech for his reform ""just like in the USA compa"""
"And the judges are going to be partisans, they are going to answer to their political bosses"
"Of course it is going to be implemented in the state judiciary, we must not misinform, it is a reality."
"They make a mistake in this video, they say that the judicial powers are not going to be affected, that is not true, as the constitutions of the states have to adhere to the federal Constitution, the governments of the states are going to have to reform their own constitutions and adapt to what the reform says, that is, they also have to take the model of the election of judges by popular vote Therefore, if this reform affects the 32 states of the Republic, it not only affects the federal Judicial Branch, such as the ministers of the Supreme Court, magistrates of the collegiate courts and federal judges, it will also affect the magistrates of the judicial branches of the states and the local judges of first instance and magistrates of second instance, hopefully and they can correct that error 1:11"
How bestial this is.
"Nor does he ask for essays, only a writing to present because the applicant wants to be a judge"
I agree
"I would like as a journalistic topic, an investigation of how the economic powers in the world have taken over the media to manipulate facts and drive opinion where they see fit"
Here watching this video to see if this means of dissemination is bought by the transnationals
He left him at the end of his term because he already knew that he would make a big fuss.
How bad are those
"Of course, it affects the States. The same thing will be done."
They forgot to mention the Saturdays.
"Hello.

Good video. All that would be missing was not only the comment of the opposition, that of Senator Marko Cortï¿1/2s, but also of someone from the ruling party, would be added. Thus, whoever sees them, can make a more informed opinion, knowing both political sides. Best regards."
"very clearly what according to ï¿1/2l and according to
his contemporaries were law and that
not in that discrimination is complete
and absolutely outside the notion of
Justice It is even ASSUMED that all
notion of Justice is part of a
discipline other than legal
because the juridical and
it is exclusively concerned with the
Law approved by positive law
not in an optimistic sense it is not positive
of optimistic but positive of position there"
"In the United States, 50 states name their Thursdays with popular vote"
"First time I don't like one of your videos, there is information that needs to be completed and better based on what the reform says, there are aspects that are already in the constitution"
"You're wrong..... THE JUDICIAL REFORM affects all Federal and Rural sectors.... State and Municipal
It affects the lives of all Mexicans..... it is a REFORM to the Laws that govern a Country.... not a political party or a private company.

With all due respect, my comment for your program Seï¿1/2orita."
"AND IF HE USES IT TO SAY IT'S WRONG, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN HIS INTEREST FOR MEXICO TO PROSPER, I SAY SO, I THINK"
Observatory of human rights that have made them asleep
"What can be expected from the opponents, Chayotero media"
It doesn't seem like a good idea...
"It is clear that the current justice system in Mexico must be changed because it does not work, but with these very specific changes, Mexico will be a second Venezuela..."
"They should include in the part of the newspaper the other side of the coin, not just one, the other side where there is criminal for many cases where judges have their whole family and even lovers working in the system, or where they release great figures related to drug trafficking or tax evasion"
Very interesting (only background music too loud!!!!)
"It is a coup d'état.
It does affect local judiciaries"
"This report talks about the judicial career... For your information it is very good in the letter.. but... Only 30% of judges and magistrates have the position by EAA judicial career, 70% is because they take the exams but have a family member or acquaintance already within the structure and thus take the position.. The other does not explain the report that the magistrates of the Supreme Court until last Monday were appointed by the Executive, many of them without having had experience in litigation as is the current presiding magistrate... Reform is the principle of reforming the entire justice system such as prosecutors' offices and others, as well as making it perfectible."
Greetings to Carlos Espejel 2:54
This is a disgrace to democracy and to the rights of the citizen.
This wave against immigrants in England is very ironic. 
"Hopefully they will realize it in time and demand a change to that rubbish of reform, those of us who have the opportunity will be a good time to leave this country"
The court is good for something because with so much impunity that exists I thought there were no judges or anything haha
DO NOT DELETE comments that DIFFER from your NEOLIBERAL GUIDELINES
No Minimum Privileges
Just as they put the exam even if it is by popular vote
"This is good news, finally corrupt out"
I love judicial reform
"There is no controversy, only the judges and ministers who do not want to let go of the bone have not served for anything with all and their titles very well we all support them 4t"
"Years and years of corruption in the judiciary. 
The people of Mexico are not stupid"
"In other words, those who have money will finance judicial political campaigns and thus have impunity."
"You are wrong, the judicial reform almost totally affects justice"
"They do not put the opinion of both parties, they only put the opinion of the opponents..."
"THERE IS A LOT OF DANGER, THAT CRIMINALS CHOOSE"
"Everything was going more or less well, until the president of the PAN who has a very bad reputation came out"
The truth is that Mexico needs changes but not to fall into going from one power to another equal or worse just to change you have to make a deep analysis and draw up a plan to improve in all aspects because crime increased with this government and it did good things but also we must not be blinded by the aid of vecas and 70 and more we have to see what direction we are going in all the aspects .
"And the people who demonstrate don't care about the law. They care that they will no longer have a chance to steal, steal and steal"
"you talked about it very nicely and too partial to one side, the truth is that this reform gives absolute power to the 4T since they have the majorities, that explains it well"
"Either they do not know how to investigate or they are ignorant, the reform was announced last year, and was presented in March, holding open forums. Not even the ambassador mentioned that he contradicted the trade agreement. In short, what a big chayote."
What a disaster!! Pure !! demagogy
"The executive is the one who sends the proposals of the judges to be elected and the congress approves them, my question is ï¿1/2 and who ensures that the president does not propose judges who are in his favor? It is the same: there are no guarantees of judicial independence if the high judges propose them to the presidency..... and so that they may be judges faithful to X president, it is better to propose judges who are faithful to the population that elected them."
"Long live Mexico, Long live the 4T, Long live AMLO!! The JUDICIAL reform Goes!!"
"Let us say that the fundamental postulate of the
positivism or one of the questions
Fundamental Principles of Positivism in
terms of discipline was the attempt
for purifying the disciplines"
So THE REFORM OR NEW REFORM IS TO PUT ASIDE THE SHAMELESS ONES OF THE TRUE SYSTEM
"BBC always gives its 'impartial' comments but always with a tendentious tone in a bad plan towards AMLO. I never heard in these 6 years real and honest analyses, always guiding in a mocking or ambiguous way but never accepting that AMLO is doing things better for the country."
Plan C goes! These judges will lose their excessive privileges!
":it is perfect that they are elected by the people, and not eternally in office, very well AMLO!!"
"Please remove from your videos the unpleasant background soundtrack that cannot be called ""mï¿1/2mï¿1/2sicaï¿1/2"", unbearable to listen to and that does not allow you to follow the story"
Mexicans are tired of those corrupt judges who only defend the ogligarkia pokita business and criminals and leave the citizens to their fate 
"It was not mentioned that the reform was carried out in the midst of a controversy over illegal overrepresentation in the chambers of the coalition led by Morena. That fact detracts from its legitimacy, since the decision does not represent the result of an agreement between all the parties, but the imposition of a single political force."
Why do we turn so much around the issue. In Mexico the only laws that exist are Herod's law and the law of the wealthy.
"In summary for the BBC, the reform of the PJ is worth a lot.... Because they did not mention that the PJ had decades to reform itself and did not feel like doing it."
"It affects democracy. In Mexico there are three autonomous powers. The executive, legislative and judicial. The executive manipulates the legislature and now wants the judiciary. It is something complicated to explain. Neither you nor anyone else can explain it so easily if you are not a lawyer and do not work in the Judiciary."
"This is how long the disinformation of the traditional media lasts, better report watching the morning or independent reporters"
"For me, this change is a little better than before. But only a little. Both systems are political. I prefer that the judiciary be independent of the executive and legislative branches and they should choose their own judges, based only on experience and the approval of many senior judges."
BBC could not be that it failed to say that the candidates will be chosen and evaluated by a council and then they will vote for them.
THEN AMLO PROPOSED A PIï¿1/2A NORM???
Background music is very annoying
"The corrupt person wants to continue living off crime and is an apologist for crime. They refuse to change their effort and they don't go to jail because they have corrupt judges, ministers and magistrates who protect them: with no crime to pursue, they wash their hands without going to a trial to prove their innocence or guilt."
"And everyone accuses the system and we must start with what happens at home, in your environment, with the apathy of Mexicans to get involved in the affairs of the country"
"The delinquent in a suit is the one who fears that he may go to jail. Be honest and you will be able to believe your business with satisfaction of your achievements and not be a rich man without scrupulous because nothing satisfies you because the value of effort generates satisfaction and joy. To not live off illicit drugs, to not consume and do everything sexually, in the workplace, because you have lost the sense of humanity and fulfillment. And you become someone who gets wealth without purpose, he is a slave to his money."
"Well, I agree with the judicial reform"
"That foreigners cannot intervene in political processes? That guy is Colombian, isn't he?"
"I need you to decide on a logo. Either they keep the current one with the old source or the one they put on, as they do with the video fly, the new one from the BBC."
Enjoying what was voted. AND LET THEM SCREAM!
No to communism and dictatorship
"Simply, the government could do whatever it wants against whomever they want and no one will be there to stop the arrogance of AMLO's government, that is why investors fear that due to a whim of the president, they will lose their invested capital.
And not only companies are in danger, but any citizen.
It goes much further than the courts of common jurisdiction."
"What controversy?? If in the United States they do,"
It's funny how he wants to look impartial but you can see that they are with the corrupt.
"I am Mexican and the note seems impartial to me, maliciously they do not talk about the nepotism recognized by the ministers of the SCJN according to a study presented by the president of the court 45% of the workers of the PJF including judges and magistrates have received access or promotion in the institution due to family influence, there are cases of entire families parents, uncles, nephews and even lovers working in the PJF. In addition to many other things that were discussed and that they do not want to mention here"
This to the Siudadans in which it affects us thank you.
"AMLO's government had many successes, I congratulate him, the truth is that they were very good years and an excellent change 

There is a detail within the bad of this government 

The worst is the national guard 
Today you must take care of them, it is the worst thing that exists and I have evidence of it 

With all due respect, Mr. President, it is a mistake, the national guard is the worst thing in your government 

Taking this away my respects and admiration for your performance and work in the country congratulations"
"Very partial video, you forgot to mention the reason for the reform, all the nepotism that exists within the judiciary, the ridiculously high salaries of officials, among many other things"
Thank you for dealing with this IMPORTANT topic that can be an example in Latin America. Excellent explanation. Greetings.
"Manipulative media detector: if they add a ""controversial, controversial, dangerous, etc."", they are editorializing and manipulating. If you understand the real situation, you know that it is a more than necessary reform."
"The administrators should take on the task of blocking all the bots of the Mexican narco-government, which only come to flood the comments section with insults."
"If you speak very nicely and everything, but better ask Ricardo Salinas Pliego how much money he owes to the SAT"
"The judiciary in Mexico is deficient, it is a fact, it needs to change."
The reforms to the amparo law that?
"Thank you the prosecutors' offices are independent so that a country like Venezuela is not lost, this was what petro wanted to do in Colombia, it is not going greetings, phenomenon of the girl 2021 to 2024"
"That resignature is the initial one, then the entire judicial system will be reaffirmed. What they do not say in this video is that the judiciary is full of nepotism and corruption, which is not a discourse because it is proven even by the court itself."
"But if it does not apply to the Prosecutor's Office or to the Police it will be of NO use, that was only a move to have a majority and do their will."
"That is how they would have taken into account the people of Mexico when the PRIAN approved reforms, that is when those who come out now would have supported us but since now this reform is going to hit them in their pockets that is why they disagree... Long live the 4th transformation."
All autocrats attack judges using all kinds of disqualifications and demagogic arguments.
The background music is distracting
"It's politicized, sir, I've already experienced that in Venezuela, I'm fooled by it"
BBC Another US media outlet 
"No, your video doesn't help me understand the topic you're addressing.

The SCJN and judges and magistrates have behaved in a political line and not a legal one as they boast. Its position is political.

The reform was discussed enough, so there were forums throughout the country, the implausible thing is that the representatives of the judiciary who spoke against it, failed to comply with what is asked of any litigant: to present evidence, vent it and generate conviction, and they only spoke with derision, mockery, repulsion for the governed and an unacceptable position of feeling like the OWNERS of the judiciary. ?

The three constitutional powers must be democratic and therefore, as structures of the State, still independent of their work among themselves, respectful of the people, sensitive to our social reality; that does not prevent them from doing their work in accordance with the law.

By the way, you willingly omitted to show that this judicial power committed crimes in its protest, that it admits appeals that the amparo law does not admit, that through crude and dastardly chicanes, it tries to delay the exercise of a power such as the legislative.

That with its strike, it violates the right of every citizen to access to justice. And it's them! The judiciary that does it!! Who protects us from them? ??
They are judge and jury.

They are the problem and they have been. 

It would be good if you mentioned that we have a 99% IMPUNITY rate and they wash their hands, insensitive, knowing it, they have done nothing to change it. They, far from the real problems of the nation

You also ignored mentioning that those protests were only from those who work in that power, who do not have social support, because society in general, rejects their work, because they are incompetent, because they are corrupt.

I never see a channel like this and I corroborate that there is no reason to attend to them. They are part of the problem. 
So young and so given to lies "
No exams 
Thank you
"Total support for Morena, good is finally being done in Mexico"
What they demand is only salaries and privileges just because austerity will be imposed on the judiciary...
without music better.
Hahaha we are not a protectorate of the United States Mexico is free and sovereign
He who does everything wrong will reform the judiciary
WE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT THE BBC IN LONDON
"I think it's a very good report, I think it's impartial"
"In any case, JUSTICE IS GOING TO BE THE SAME, IT IS ONLY GOOD FOR NOTHING, NOW IT IS GOING TO BE WORSE"
Cristina Fernandez's dream of ...
"Well done AMLO, Mexico ! For Alante"
Morena the new PRI.
Norma Piï¿1/2a must fall!
The BBC cries!!
That lady herself confessed how she was elected. X the interests of Peña Nieto and the last in notes and distinctions
Bravo AMLO  La Piï¿½a ni para la Piï¿½ata
Enough of privileges and neopotism and favoring the oligarchs
"especially in its most important and most important
Fine and brighter exponent that is
Hans kelsen eh And basically what
Kelsen does is create a theory that
even ï¿1/2l makes Called pure theory of the
right in which not to make them the
A very long story what it does is generate
A series of criteria to distinguish
very clearly what according to ï¿1/2l and according to
his contemporaries were law and that
not in that discrimination is complete
and absolutely out of the way"
"Please, if the cops don't mess with the cops out of fear"
"And in your opinion, do you consider it good or bad?"
"Video of disinformation, investigate the background, nothing more drop bullets like a fool!!"
"Very bad reporting, many details were missing, but even so with the new judicial law, the injunctions to tax debtors were over, starting with Salinas Pliego who owes 65 million in taxes and the piï¿1/2a judge granted him injunctions"
"Hahahaha, CORRUPT JUDGES TREMBLE!!! Good AMLO "
"I just realized that you are very beautiful and pretty, Laura Garcia."
BLESSED GOD. The judicial system is the most corrupt and rotten in all of Mexico.
And no one is going to talk about the gassed?
"The foreigners believing and now the corrupt who protected us will no longer be there. Well, live honestly and you will be able to do business that benefits you. Implement business strategies do not try to live off exploitation and then complain about the rights of the floor. You complain about the crime you encourage."
Hahahahaha
The president explains that salaries and biatic payments or lunches of the day are excessive live like kings. earned more than the president himself. The benefits they receive annually are severely high.
"A biased and not at all informative video, by putting the voices of Norma Piï¿1/2a and Marko Cortï¿1/2s as references of the ""invitation to the right thing"", do nothing but lose value. You can see who financed the video."
"Your music bothers you too much, waters on that"
THERE ARE MANY DELINQUENTS WITH TITLES AND WITHOUT TITLES
"Why so much interest of the gringos in the judiciary... I wonder?
If the tubes remain, it was worth the vegetable and if the Kamala remains, it is the same.. What do they do to the MMDA."
"A great president, I wish Petro were like that"
"This information brief is definitely good, but it does not describe the current reality of the Mexican judicial system. I lived in Mexico and I know firsthand that the Mexican courts are real sewers infested with rats. Corruption in the courts is extremely regrettable. A radical change in this branch of the Mexican justice system is imperative. 
On the other hand, the United States should not even try to give an opinion on this issue, because right now, we Americans have a group of judges who were designed by former President Trump and who have gone to the extreme of granting him total impunity to break the laws and commit crimes!
Of course, the changes that are taking place in Mexico do not guarantee that the problems of injustice will be solved automatically, but it is a necessary step and in the end the success of this reform will depend on Mexicans respecting their own laws and acting with more honesty and respecting the rights of their fellow citizens."
ï¿½Se aprobï¿½? 
"What a shame BBC, only voices against, that a young woman is the one to explain something so important.
Why don't you say girl that thanks to the judiciary that exists today it is impossible to transform a poor country into an independent one? Ahh I also forgot that the BBC defends transnational corporations."
"""The Tyranny of the Majorities...."""
"They don't want changes and then they go around whining that ""the same judges let the narcos and corrupt politicians go free, that's why so much drama"
Reform or dictsdura???
"Superficial, not at all outstanding in terms of information; Before this law you had to prove that you really knew the law, now any ""nice"" neighbor is going to occupy a position of utmost delicacy.
That they take away absurd canons? I totally agree, but putting an end to the possibility of those who really know reaching the Magistrates is really a blunder.
You don't mention anything specific, you go ""over"" the topics without getting into depth, badly, very badly BBC.
You don't understand that after the elections Mexico will live on ochlocracy."
It is a whim of an arrogant president.... Not all Mexicans are pend....
How good Amlo. Here they didn't have the balls and that's how we are....
The PRI resurfaces with another name returning to have the power of everything.
"Good video, very informative as always, without a doubt a healthy justice is very important for the progress of a country, I am not from Mexico, I am from Honduras because I would ask Mexicans what they think about that reform since in the news it appears that it generates polarity their country, it is only out of curiosity,  in short, greetings and a hug ????.

Ps: I hope that the BBC can dedicate a video to the situation in my country, lately it seems that society is going to explode, we are going to elections in a year and 4 months and everything is very polarized and there is a lot of expectation since Xiomara Castro, the current president has a very questionable popularity (and many are concerned that she is very close to Maduro and Chavismo) but the opposition is also very corrupt would be an interesting topic to deal with greetings ????."
Foreign intervention is urgent!
"It's okay what the cotton guy did, we have to make the new system work and from there it could be threatened with the vote of the citizens if it lacks more Salt in the Soup"
SO AMAZING IS THAT REFORM THAT THE ONLY FOREIGN COUNTRY TO APPLAUD IT WAS VENEZUELA 
"BBC controversy? Why is its header no other, such as: historical. Ahh I already remembered you are one of those who mark the line, very straight."
"But it is a democratic reform, driven by a democratically elected president and a democratically elected congress with a majority of votes... now the problem is going to be for those who oppose it is that they will not be able to corrupt millions of Mexicans who vote for those who they believe are the right ones for office... and the judges who are now ... 15 years!!!! they will lose their privileges that the MAJORITY OF MEXICANS DO NOT HAVE... We are going ahead with that reform..."
Thank you very much for your information for an informed and unmanipulated people long live the 4th. transformation and long live AMLO who did not give up in his conviction and before retiring exhibited more rottenness that defended the powerful but powerful from stealing and plundering our beautiful country
A relatively unbiased analysis of reform at last
I think your channel lacks more in-depth information about Mexico and the judiciary... Because if they have no concept.. It is one of the most corrupt organizations
"Mexico was screwed and it's going to be fucked up more, well being Venezuela is very attractive and strange that this presenter who is Mexican was not more critical, but well she speaks from her privilege living in London and not in the poverty that is her country Mexico, she says tell us not to talk to us, learn to speak since she doesn't even know how to investigate hahaha"
"In Mexico they have not explained to us exactly what this reform consists of. Thank you BBC, for explaining to us."
"The judicial reform has already been approved, this was the will of Mr. President Andrés Lï¿1/2s Lï¿1/2pez Obrador, which is the change that always along, it is good, the only thing that we want to go well, we do not want to hear that on the day of tomorrow they say that it did not go well and those food or ï¿1/2blame the United States that it is to blame for what come in"
"Hahahahaha too late Marco Cortï¿1/2s, they had all the opportunities during their governments and dedicated themselves to cheapening the homeland, traitors!"
A reform of a burning river
2:20
Mexico (:
"Now judges and magistrates should be popular. Wow, wow, now let's close them by making videos dancing on tiktok or they will be subordinate to those who contribute money to their campaign. What innocents!!"
"What a setback for that, poor Mexicans who support this dictator"
You didn't explain to us even mothers but thank you
"As usual, the corporate media totally inclined to the right, listening only to one side and of course seeing everything wrong, they don't care that the majority of Mexicans agree, they are neoliberal right-wing corporate media and now even anti-democratic."
What will a judge promise in the campaign? punitive populism? Obrador has disappointed me. Judges must be away from any political confrontation because otherwise the application of the law will be a political application. Will Obrador like this reform when the majority of the judges are not of his political tendency?
"Your information is not complete, the judiciary only benefits national and foreign businessmen, the population in general does not exist for justice, the president interferes in the elections, they earn a huge salary, half of the judiciary are family members so there is no judicial career, and many more abuses.  SO I RECOMMEND YOU DO YOUR JOB BETTER, DON'T GIVE THE WRONG IDEA"
"what finesse of corruption.. alito, Cortes and Piï¿1/2a .. What a beautiful family.."
"Your information is very tendentious, you don't touch on the real underlying issues, ah it's the BBC, OK"
The reform is a way to eliminate the division of powers and thereby ensure a re-election
"in etymological terms, that is, what
It's already put there by the bodies
entitled to do so in this case
Well, the legislative chambers that is what
The only one that, based on this Vision, is
relevant to the lawyer then eh Ni
It hasn't even been like a kind of eh
result of how it has been taught
one of the fundamental pillars of the
Contemporary legal vision
justice is not part of the object of the
real lawyer under this view Hey"
"BBC your opinion is not necessary to Mexico, the government is obeying a mandate from the people of Mexico. Your opinion, like that of the gringo embassy, is interventionist. It respects the sovereignty of the Mexican people and government."
One of the most corrupt countries in America
"Worse video I have not seen, go to the channel of Maestro Carbonell, the Yes mentions the main problem that will be who judges the judges"
I am going to run for congress in Houston and texas want to close the border.
"He argues so much why now they are asking for the title and ID? that is?????  wow 
Goodbye to the Kept"
"No, this video did not help me at all, corruption has always been in the 3 powers and so far I do not see any of them free of corruption, they blame one power when the other 2 are the same"
"excellent!! Every couple who got there, that's over, bravo bravo!! "
"I want to know the news straight from you, so I want english subtitles. I want to know what you guys are saying and if I see from telemundo I will get a general news they have to cater to every immigrant from latin America. They have to be very careful with white washing and Hispanic rivilaly."
More than 50% of PJ workers are family members.
Welcome to the new PRI
"How strange of the left-handed AMLO, to get into another power"
Great more money in the trash in campaigns
"The piï¿1/2a did not arrive because he had completed a judicial career. It arrived by direct designation. His career as a judge was unproductive and he was the most stupid. He does not know about constitutionality.
This story is very biased. Why don't they interview the other party, personalities of the 4T. Now this chain is losing credibility!! He is very lying."
"I have been affected by the judiciary and magistrates currently colluding by their own interests or outside influences and who have been threatened by them, have themselves been in power for decades. Now that justice is in the hands of the people, now they cry."
"you say Amlo and his ""allies"" as if it were a marginal sect ""why aren't you clearer? better than AMLO and the majority of the people of Mexico. Don't you think it's worth clarifying the dimension of popular approval that this measure has?"
MEXIT of the FTA [TMEC]
"Good for amlo. Because that is how the privileges for these ministers who live off the people came to an end. All their families who did what they wanted ran out of their minita. And yet Jay Venes that without being magistrates they support them, because they are masochists."
"Beer beer pii¿1/2ita, was vast"
"The whys? They never consider them! It is urgent and necessary to make changes in the Judiciary, it is currently a Brotherhood of relatives and friends, with offensive privileges for citizens; an angry situation; because, in addition to being corrupt, they do not comply with their minimum obligations. Because among many of its barbarities, there are thousands of people, all of them of low economic resources, in prison, without a sentence."
Why this bull .... Get me subscribed when I don't like it.
The BBC always tendentious.... and right-wing.
Moo... In a dark-haired way!
"I thought this channel was unbiased but its narrative is completely leftist, more so as the video opens. "
Omfg !!!!!!
Chayoteros...
"Well, I think it is good that judges should have at least a level of university study and 5 years of experience and references; What is really controversial is that a ""witch hunt"" is going to start and that some corrupt politicians will be untouchable because of the agreements that were made behind the scenes, which would happen anyway if the judicial reform had not been approved. Obviously, this reform has an economic impact since it leaves uncertainty for many companies. Only in time will we see how it affects the free market."
"BBC News as a Mexican I tell you that you definitely have to have an unbiased host, she is a clear follower of the 4T, if you want to preserve your prestige as an independent and impartial press. With the pity, today I give dislike to his video."
"Super tendentious video, how they put MarKKKo Cortés, that guy could sell his own mother for the right price... He's a gangster.,"
If the inept AMLO turned out to be a danger!
"With this reform, we are almost Venezuela"
"And you failed to say that AMLO told them to reform themselves and they didn't want to, that was missing to say"
He charged us the 
This video tries to minimize the impact of the misnamed reform of the PJ. DON'T LET THEM SEE YOUR FACE!!
How good it was already necessary to clean that gold mine that was for many white-collar thieves
The only legacy he will leave behind is a lot of internal and external political problems to his successor
"If he wanted better discipline, the military already has them in everything, the fear of Mexican society is that with this opening the narco will be able to nominate judges through his operators, in exchange for political favors of money. This modification is very risky, history has shown that the more they democratize the government, the sooner it will go to ruin."
Mexico is headed in the path of Venezuela and Cuba 
Grime whim of the worst president in the world
Two tacos please
AMLO is a populist.
Controversy for you
They also want to reform Congress and remove Los Pluris and not allow there to be sloppy or sellouts.
And also that the newscasts that misreport are punished.
"That is, you are not going to vote and elect a faceless judge, of the judges elected and already known, one would be the faceless judge in cases of organized crime, you will not know who of them was, so it will be logical."
"Don't be clumsy boy, you won't elect faceless judges, citizens will elect judges with faces, but criminals won't know who will judge them when they are prosecuted"
Because they don't reduce the Guebones of DEPUTIES WITH NEW COMPUTERS AND CELL PHONES FOR NOTHINGMORE TO GO TO SLEEP OR CHAT OR NOT GO 500 MAINTAINED FROM 100 THOUSAND PESOS ONWARDS
"How BRUTE, BRUTE..... Put zero on it... Even a child understands faceless judges."
"Incredible that person who is explaining (misinforming), if he is going to say things he should say them well."
What absurd comparisons. The faceless judge has nothing to do with knowing the judges for whom they are voted.
"I like your strategy to communicate, but in terms of what is happening politically in the country and especially your explanation of how the votes to elect ministers and judges will be, with all due respect you should find out more and better, do you think that those who are right now are a shower of wisdom?
There is a lot of corruption and if one day you need the service, I wish you to get a non-CORRUPT Honorable Judge.
WE ARE IN A TRANSFORMATION
WHAT THE MEXICAN PEOPLE ENDORSE AND HOPE THAT IT IS FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL, NOT FOR THE ONE THAT HAS MORE"
"Typical of corrupt governments, those who ""sovereign the country"" who ""international interference"" who ""don't stick their noses in"" ah, but when they need support of any kind, then they do remember that the international community exists, international law."
"Don't confuse your audience, people are going to vote for judges and magistrates and once elected, the one who judges narcos are the ones who won't have a face, you're already like a chumel"
"I do not feel that modifying the popular vote will end corruption, there must be the most prepared people, with experience, the polular does not mean that it is the best and if it does not work you remove it."
Now if as moms say YOU ARE OR DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF?  You know very well what they mean by faceless judges.
The president explains that the people are going to elect the judges. But it does not explain that it will not be by direct election but through the senators. Because they deduce that senators are representatives of the people. So if Morena has more senators
"I don't understand how anyone can believe that we are going to do better if it is not their knowledge but their popularity that puts the judges in office.
That is, a judge who demonstrated that he or she has more knowledge than 15 other people is somehow worse than someone who only had to prove that he or she had to study law.
Not only that, that judge should prove his knowledge after having held lower positions, after a judicial career, HAVING EXPERIENCE.
That they review one by one the sentences of each judge and make it clean, perfect, but a system must be improved not destroyed, we are talking about positions that imply KNOWLEDGE and 95% of the population do not know the basic culture of Law to elect a judge or magistrate.
On the other hand, electing deputies by vote, see the wonder of imbicil people who arrive, I don't want to imagine what barbarities await with elected judges based on their charisma and the sponsorship of some political godfather. ???"
"It is an exceptional judicial reform, it benefits Mexico, there will be true justice, which our country needs very much."
"Congratulations on the approval of the election by popular vote for the judiciary, as well as the executive and legislative branches are currently elected. The current judicial system is useless. The reason for which crimes are generated is much greater than what is judged. For serious crimes such as murder or organized crime, they should be removed from society to an island. In a conscious and integral society, anyone could be a judge."
"That is, empirical experience says that this is useless and is a failure, if it were so it would have an enormous cost for the victims."
Well said by the Mexican president.
"The meaning of faceless judges is not knowing who is conducting the trial to avoid reprisals,"
Very cool narrates the news..
"It's not that hard to understand. What is approved today is that the ruler in Mexico now has no counterweights and could do whatever he wants, without anyone judging him."
Very good newspaper answer thank you
"Cordial greetings That's right, no country has to intervene in the Sovereignty and less of something that is against corruption, we do not need sultans in the Judiciary, point the people voted and it is respected greetings Nacho"
JUDICIAL REFORM IS EXCELLENT 
"Pure stupidity says this kid, but let's do the right thing, let's stop seeing and listening to him, let's change the medium, until never means of disinformation."
"Respect for the rights of others is peace, the gringos and any foreign institution or government, must respect sovereignty and the Constitution that governs the rights and obligations of Mexico."
Excellent
"All the people know and they have already decided it, out with the rotten judiciary, out with great privileges, out with great salaries, out with great baricia, long live the new reform of the judiciary, long live the progress of the people, the people pay and command"
"THERE IS MY PRECIOUS NACHO!
THE TIGER IS LOOKING FOR TALENT LIKE YOURS, WITH MORAL AUTHORITY, DIGNITY, HONESTY, HONESTY AND HARMONY TO GOVERN THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY."
"The faceless judges I suppose that one of the judges who has been elected by vote will be drawn, the constitutional right to reserve identity for security reasons being"
"That the offender will not know who is going to judge him 
We will vote for the judges we want 
But faceless because you won't know who will hand down the sentence."
In the United States there are faceless judges
"Here and everywhere there is corruption, so we need honest and prepared people"
GO AHEAD WITH THE REFORM. OUT WITH NORMA AND HER DEFENDERS
"Remember Nachito I know you have your own perspective, but knowing TV is different, I'm sorry Nachito this time you are not right"
"Voting for judges is fatal
We don't even know the senators for whom we vote 
And then everything by vote???
Hauled and Sold
Some are bad and corrupt, others are worse
Or who to trust
Poor Mexico"
"Desonfirma, I already denounced this video as disinformation."
Judicial power in favor of the corrupt and criminals... and against the people...
Oh q be objective please
"I like you so much, if only the information was given without editorializing, we would be well informed."
"Congratulations Nacho Lozano, Original way of informing, you started in the Program to whom it corresponds a long time ago and look now, a Great Professional of the News and a great human being, Blessings Always!! "
"It is the first time that the students of Mexico demonstrate against Mexicans and are in favor of the privileges of corrupt ministers, and even more so because it is a public university, an autonomous university, a university with a history of struggle in favor of the people.  It's disappointing."
"Faceless judges are a dubious figure .....
THE WHOLE REFORM IS DOUBTFUL.  
The regime seeks to get away with it...."
Everyone fighting the bone 
"They are not faceless, so is simplifying the opposition and the media. They are determining extra protection measures for those judges. Chale Nacho"
" Faceless judges in a trial, not in the election. There are no... What communicators... "
Medina Moorish was ! Accountant! And no one said anything! And he put it fox! But since it's not bread! Now everything is wrong! Ridiculous! And the rule is already trembling!
"? WE SPENT MILLIONS ON FEDERAL ELECTIONS AND NOW WE WILL ALSO PAY TO ELECT THE PJ. THOSE RESOURCES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO SOMETHING MORE USEFUL.
IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL EXERCISE JUSTICE WITHOUT CORRUPTION?"
Did you fail to say if those who pirated the thesis can apply?
IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST THE REFORM.
National march for judicial reform
Canada and the United States here in Mexico do not send ????
"In the United States, the majority of judges are elected by popular vote."
I congratulate you for your work you do it super 
"You are very nice!  Don't talk about what you don't know, you don't have to talk seriously.  Best regards"
"I think that the most indispensable thing is that we must emphasize.
That they are in favor of the progress and development of MEXICO and Mexicans and that they can be tried for crimes of corruption and delinquency.
It is not concerned with knowing about laws but with what has to be done and they only speak to reject everything that has to do with the people (Mexico)"
It is that in the USA we do vote for judges and it works since the alleged never knows his judge until the trial begins
Chingón the pinche Nacho Lozano.
"Just when it seems like you're achieving neutrality, you go out with your stuff."
"What is going to be done with the REFORM is 
1 THAT NO PUBLIC SERVANT EARNS MORE THAN THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY 
2 LET THE LAWS BE JUST, AND LET THE LAW NOT BE IN YOUR FAVOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE MONEY. 
3 THAT ALL WORKERS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE UP"
"If the reform !! Out with corrupt, lifers, traitors!! Judges and magistrates "
"It's not true Nachito, this government is right, honest and sincere!"
Divine Nacho!! They don't care! The precise one is right!
"Nacho already shut up, report yourself first, you are misinforming."
I thought this man was a little smarter.
We want the reform and that's it
"To the driver, all those interested in the new proposal, must comply with experience and evaluations of their own for the position and specific evaluation committees ï¿1/2 be well evaluated.  Enough of BLA bla bla"
The faceless judge comes after they are elected. Endejo.
"JUDICIAL REFORM IS URGENTLY NEEDED TO IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND ELIMINATE THE PRIVILEGES OF THE GOLDEN CLASS, IMPROVE THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC MINISTRIES AND ELIMINATE IMPUNITY."
"Good driver, but do not distort the information, obviously they give you a line in your medium."
Out with the judiciary and the corrupt piï¿1/2ata
"But they don't even know who governs them, names or trajectory, just give them a populist support and the sheepish people will vote. I feel that we continue to feel a country with an ignorant majority and it's worth it. They only vote to stretch out their hand."
I was surprised that Nacho didn't understand about the faceless judges
You are very skilled at distorting information.
Also that political positions disappear and parties are a few little pairs.
"Nachin is bad, it's not because there is.
You don't really see what the people want, because you are not living the injustices of the judiciary.
You are also a chayotero"
Excellent renovation
Let's go for plan c
"All those people who have a political position SHOULD be discharged every six years and then scratch with their own hands so they do not become corrupt or webons if they are teachers to give keys if they are GRADUATES whatever they are to work like any citizen.
NOW THE JUDGES WHO WILL JUDGE THEM FOR SENTENCING SOMEONE WHO IS INNOCENT"
Average of 8. Mediocre Mexico.
"How about the faceless one being a criminal? He must have no demands, he must not have child support debts, he must not be a child supporter, he must not be a child supporter."
"Anyone wants to think about the salaries of the poor judges and their families, please, they are suffering "
That Nacho defends the privileges of his bosses
"Better to discuss the prices of gasoline, ISR, VAT all for low"
There should also be only 2 political parties as in most countries
"Well, if it's weird. Because if a judge or magistrate who does not fulfill his duty and you want to remove him from his position you have to know his name and logically his face. You have to know him to remove him or vote for him yes no as you choose one."
"I already denounced this video for misleading content, so those who realize the misinformation here should do it "
We are fed up with so much corruption and lack of justice in the judiciary that are changed every six years
"A serious national news outlet should be impartial and objective, not make ironic comments either for or against"
I liked faceless judges and at the same time they are reviewed.
"So with that reform is more control of everything, ""elected by the people"" Venezuela?"
"And what is the difference between a lever to enter a high position or an average of 8? Please, we all know how high positions in government and the judiciary work."
Well cast excellent reform
That's true
"Up THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY NOW YES TO PAY TAXES, ENOUGH MESIC EXPENSES TO 100, ENOUGH BONUSES EVERY 4 months m, etc NOW IF ALL COLLUDES OR ALL RABONORS let the people choose them "
"The judges, magistrates and ministers: let the people choose.... they have the chance to work without tricks.   The current ones no longer ... to honorable exceptions"
"Deciding haha, the river passes without changing a comma what your lord says. Wacala the Legislative Branch "
"If we are bad now, faceless judges, we are going to be worse.  Who came up with that, brunette. "
"Image and its, out with corrupt judges, total support for Morena."
"Yes, how do you do pppp"
There is evidence only in proceedings against organized crime
Thank you for this type of information because on this issue we are too far behind and I think the reform towards sports is perfect if they are more transparent and other sports have the necessary federal financial support and controlled as long as the large owners pay what corresponds to the law for the benefit of the country
They need to check their benefits like many vacations a year or interfere when the citizens
"It's not like you say it is. Rather, reform is something that makes new prospects candidates."
"If it is possible just that they do not say who accuses them and who defends them, This has always existed"
The reform is very necessary to clean up the Judiciary
Disinformation with such a reach should be a crime
"We didn't know the judges in the past six years and now you complain that you won't know him, you should look for excuses for the president "
A reform is needed to punish anyone who gives 6:23 bad information just to protect the interests of a company
"The faceless judges would emerge from the same faceless judges. But faceless is at the time of being assigned or taking a high-risk case, not to choose it."
"And what good is it if the postulates already have more, that is, they are already corrupt"
"You don't even know your local deputies, it seems you're going to meet a judge. That they reform the prosecutors' offices, which is where the preliminary investigations are carried out and is where corruption is carried out."
Cases of drug trafficking and organized crime must be prosecuted by the SEDENA
Here in the USA the people elect their judges
"It is coherent, I think it is to put an end to impunity, especially in Mexico"
"The faceless thing would be fine
Well, as a good citizen it forces you to investigate its trajectory!"
Let's go with the reform
"I understand faceless judges, like when they are commissioned to judge a person because it is not known who it is that sentences him and handles the case"
"If there is no face or signature, another can be a judge and say: there was a sentence, without having a signature or anything."
If there are judges with plagiarized theses. And these. Making a mockery of the law degree 
He has the voice of the rooster Claudio 
"The Judicial Power must be reformed, the still ministers, judges, magistrates and lawyers cannot give an opinion because it is messing with the Power of the People of all Mexico ????"
"I live in the country where justice is not done, a rich man comes and gives money to the minister or judges to let him go free, now the people will better elect the best prepared"
"It doesn't matter who they are going to be, but that they do the job correctly and for the benefit of the people and all the media should keep track of the work they have to do and not just be criticizing foolishly!"
9 years ........ in Oaxaca there were some Magistrates with more than 30 years in the Court and a month ago 7 of them asked for their Retirement in one fell swoop.......
It's very good that they don't know the judges
"Also that they deform I say reform the military commanders SEDENA know who chooses the secretary of national defense, if the one who leaves his post."
"Well bought the nachito, they already gave it for the chewing gum, and also for the little one"
Those who are going to run must say ugh I already feel safe 
"It is assumed that the candidates are people qualified for the position who are proposed by the 3 powers and the people will vote for those who best suit them according to their career, they are not simple lawyers Nacho"
In favor of the reform pure plan C
"It is competition if Latinus has the broso Clown.

Image has #Nacho"
"They did not listen to the young people, and they are the future of Mexico why not listen to them"
"It refers to the fact that the official sentencing document will not appear the name of the judge, these presenters are very stupid"
It will be ignorant but in what does this reform benefit or affect ??!
"Nacho, you're failing me. He investigates what faceless judges are referring to. Don't embarrass me. Please."
It was already thought of before giving so many positions
"There is Nacho why so much explanation is the end of the corruption of the judiciary, innocent people in jail and criminals in the streets. Even Osiel Cï¿1/2 orders come for his protection and let him go free. Why so much explanation "
Mmmm Broso's substitute has already fallen
"Yes, let them reform. What doesn't work has to make it work."
It's crazy
"The door is open for people who are prepared and who meet the requirements to be able to get the job!! THEY WILL NO LONGER NEED A GODFATHER, A RELATIVE TO A LEVER OR GIVE A MOCHE OF MONEY TO GET THE JOB.. THAT'S OVER!! OUT WITH THE PRIVILEGES AND THE LIFE OF KINGS."
"Nothing that comes from the fourth class has real and legitimately beneficial benefits... be independent, objective and review the statistics and draw your conclusions..."
"Advance the reform, and get rid of the corrupt judges."
They are afraid that the countries will open their eyes and demand equal changes against the corrupt !!
Oh Nachito it is logical that the face is for choice but in the case of trial is where in the case of sentencing for highly dangerous criminals linked to cartels well mentioned that is where anonymity will be handled and why not if to date the criminals are all mentioned with the surname N and that is also anonymity.!
"https://youtu.be/nlS1sVhZgjg?si=QCRCls-0QWDRB-bK as Mexicans we have lost faith in everything... our politicians, our institutions, however, I believe that we must give the opportunity to the new generations to express themselves because they are gestating change and today the UNAM Law School has called for a march in defense of the judiciary, not the Tec, l or the Ibero, no, the UNAM, the university of the people... There must be a reason why."
"How when they ask you for experience, it is illegitimate that you get experience if they do not give you the opportunity, rather that all those who are in positions of the judiciary with so much privilege, do not want to let someone else take their place, besides so many corrupt and cynical judges, what better to give the opportunity to other people"
"Whatever comes, I am sure that it will be better than what we have now in the judiciary."
"This change is not even for all the American people to know about it and for them to be clear long live Mexico long live our president and long live our democracy up our people, long live the good God bless you"
"Explain the topic directly and keep your personal opinions, it is a newscast, not a flea market"
Hahahaha if it's true faceless judges how are we going to vote for them what are you Morena legislators burruming
It's okay to have a faceless judge in the face of the crimes of the bad guys because then they go around liquidating them
"But the judges will be several and they will not know who they appoint in their case, also less likely to be bribed"
"They should be with identification as the PRESIDENT, but when it comes to being judged instead of having the name they should have a single sheet of paper so that that sheet is the one who shows its face in case of an audit, observation or review of certain cases!"
"That there is no corruption in the system and even less in Guanajuato
Listen to me that joke"
"Tell us, with all due respect, get to work and let the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate do their work and from there proceed what has to be done according to the law. Cycles end, they are not eternal, changes are always good."
"He looks like my ex, I remember his face"
"It is perfect that the cleanup of corrupt judges begins, who has not suffered from an arrest, a sentence ï¿1/2 an abuse of a judicial authority I congratulate you but there must be very few"
"There is a university in which a government figure graduated as a lawyer overnight

This is for those who intend to run as a candidate for judge "
"SINCE THEY INTEND, ACCORDING TO THE 'MORENA, TO GIVE POSITIVE CHANGES, THEY ALSO CHANGE AND €¿1/2 WHATEVER: ONE DEPUTY PER STATE AND ONLY THREE SENATORS IN TOTAL FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.... IN ADDITION TO ELIMINATING EVERYTHING, ABSOLUTELY ALL THE MONEY, SINCE IT IS A WASTE TO GIVE THOSE AMOUNTS TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES.... REDUCE THE POLITICAL PARTIES TO ONLY TWO AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY INTEND POSITIVE CHANGES."
"Not my friend, he says that you choose them first and at the time of judging they will not see those who are cases of those...., do not confuse"
No wey if you vote for that minister but only in case of judging criminals of organized crime
"Oh Nachito, I like you but you are KGndo."
5:01 Anyway he will look for a way to get revenge and it could even be worse
Their faces will be covered at the time they judge a criminal
"Well explained, what do the opponents fear?"
"We are up to the hat that all institutions write their laws, and sign them"
"In the U.S., those who dictate who is guilty or innocent 
It is a jury of people, chosen at random from the American people who generally have no experience in law
The judge only rules on the sentence that should be served
In any decision of the jury"
That the judges already known... it is useless because no one knows them... Not even anyone in our country knew who they were..... they are abject. Cheaters and it's good that they're leaving
"Well said, who the people are, the people are all the people of Mexico, the problem is that the PRIAN and these judges defended a part of the people, who were the rich, and for the others there was no justice, that is what the opponents do not understand."
"They are going to continue to put their family and friends, positions only with influence and their little paper that they are Lic. In law ... Well, they pay for it"
"And this is why they are afraid that there will be reform? What are they afraid of, also the judge will not have because they know who the accused is, they only need the evidence, the witnesses, the testimonies and that's how cold should it be justice, what need will they have to know the name or see the alleged guilty of drug trafficking?  of money laundering etc should be facelessly charged as well"
Excellent judicial reform.
"To begin with, they should not have a majority in the chamber because they can approve whatever they want here, the point is that there are no small letters and then they come out with their, no cronyism, no manipulation to favor those of Morena and their henchmen"
I think that here human rights support the aggressors
They also punish the journalists who are now coming out to take the victims
"The laws are made or modified by the legislators and those who have to abide by are the two powers that are the executive branch and the judicial power, because those two powers have the obligation to accept and comply with the laws that come out of the legislative power, also the legislative branch has the power to make political judgments against any public servant as they did with a capital chief who had his power taken away from him. He was imprisoned and today he asks for justice against those bad servants, which is the reform of the Judiciary."
You can vote for a faceless judge in order to see his or her readiness.
"Well, let them remove the judges, deputies, senators and just leave AMLO, so we save money, and let them go begging.
After all, this is the country of one man."
That false information on television be punished
"WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT POLITICS, NOTHING!"
A question with all due respect and from my ignorance. To me as an ordinary person how does it affect or benefit me?
Judges who judge will not be seen by the criminal
Speak what it is without stirring people up
"The average is 9, plus more than 5 years of experience in the specific field, not having participated in federal office, and an impeccable resume. You have to say complete the information"
What is the context or meaning of rï¿1/2 when referring to a government
Even police and military cover their faces during the arrest of drug traffickers and other major criminals. The judiciary should monitor that the assigned judge complies with the requirements. Is it required to see his face and know his authorized biography?
"Faceless will only be to sentence, not to elect them"
"Now the issue without faces is not a sure thing, but we do know that those who have faces have not done anything good to make up for the salary they earn."
"Can someone tell me how much money, in millions, has been thrown away with the exceeded benefits for ministers, magistrates and judges for bad results and how much more they are going to cost us with their poorly deserved pensions?"
"WE ARE THE ONES WHO PAY THEM !!! AND PAY WHAT IS FAIR !! NO LUXURIES !!!! AND SINCE WE PAY THEM, WE CAN CHOOSE THEM, WE ARE IN A DEMOCRACY.... OR NOT ???? AND OF COURSE THERE WILL BE FAILURES AND CORRECTIONS, BUT IT IS PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC EXERCISE!!!"
"I don't agree, they have to show their face, on the other hand in a trial you see the face of the judge because it is in the court where they make the sentences, that the face of the judges is shown, how will we vote,? Without seeing his face,?"
In the link of the following comment you can see an interview that was done with Judge Piï¿1/2a where she herself recognizes that she was not chosen because she was the most qualified but the most in the interests of power and the business oligarchy
"What they want is for CORRUPTION to continue, and with the transformation they are going to end the privileges for the rockers, the decisions in favor of foreigners who transgress the laws, in a word, there will be LAW AND IT WILL BE RESPECTED BY EVERYONE EQUALLY."
I share this initiative of Morena and that 9 of the 11 current ministers go to hell.
"1600 are voted with a face, then when they judge now you will not know which judge judged you just like that."
"THEY ARE SEEING AND THEY DON'T SEE, CHANGE IS COMING TO JUSTICE AND THAT'S IT."
"Viva Andrés, Manuel Lï¿1/2pez Obrador "
"No, make no mistake, Nachito, what worries us is that the reforms will not be approved."
What will be required to be a news anchor?
"Fifteen years are for retiring with juicy, lifetime pension ..."
And why do you think that Mexico should be on its knees before foreigners and not for that reason the weight is devalued?
"It is obvious that those who have the varo, will not want to let go, there are risks that there will be bad people or corrupt infiltrators if they approve it, but do they not believe that there are already some currently and worse earning absurdly high salaries compared to most jobs in the country? How many memes have there been of people sleeping in the chambers of deputies.-."
My brother also for the municipal presidents that there is a law that if he does not fulfill what he promises he will be punished by the law with a maximum penalty of 6 to 12 years in prison why do some continue to play with the people in that way I assure you that there is no way for him to play with the people to the full weight of the law and also that they send him federal injectors aggressive government officials to supervise every detail in what was promised to the people during their campaign and an aggressive federal government accountant is the only way that municipal and state presidents will walk right hand in hand to gradually adjust and disappear betrayal of the vote of the people in some states of the republic
"Laughable but it's clear, in the delegations example in Iztapalapa in the neighborhoods, those with vests or employees of the people, workers of AMLO etc, if they don't like you they don't help you, they turn you around, they delay the service etc, ah but if you are a friend, comadre, neighbor or relative obvious or they like you there if they quickly support you they put you in without so much paperwork,  etc, etc. The point is that if in delegations or neighborhoods, you skip a process for what has already been mentioned, what is expected in something bigger? From the simplest positions or the most technical ways they must recruit neutral or neutral thinking people to support evenly, you need people with values, morals, ethics, I have seen very few people who really do their job."
"Listen to that, what was proposed in the political reform that the PRIAN rejected "
I like you no doubt they also tell you what to say
A faceless judge?... and corruption is going to end?... and the BEST PRESIDENT OF MEXICO?....
"Those who were already president of Mexico should no longer be in public office, Mrs. Calderón should no longer be in public positions, who have already stopped screwing around, spend the millions they have in other countries to enjoy life"
Zero recommended 
"I believe that it is just, because if the people choose who governs, why not elect those who will impart justice in the country...
And Nacho Lozano, that which he says in ""jest"" that because he is a supporter of MORENA he is already eligible, so far I have not seen him say even jokingly, the same of the PRI members in public office ...
Have they already reached the price?"
"Nacho to the People it is clear to the People what we want with the Reforms of the current Rotten Judicial Power.
Stop looking for hair in the soup.
The lion believes that everyone is of the same condition."
THAT IS WHY THEY CONFUSE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY TELL THE NEWS IN THEIR FAVOR. FURTHER ENTANGLING THE MATTER. FACELESS IS THAT IT IS A CASE ESPECIALLY FOR ORGANIZED CRIME
Check the popular vote is a useless expense if with a judicial career they do not know why reading a book does not give them experience being a judge or minister or magistrate and the constitution requires that they tell you what and who accuses you of
"To Gev, no country has the right to get involved, where it does not care, Mexico is free and sovereign and the people also rule."
"The old regime returns. But now with a mixed Political Class but rising from the ashes, they brought it back with a charismatic face."
And it has already been shown that it does not have it. Not all master's degrees or doctorates are synonymous with morality and honesty.
"Don't lie, it's not because of the reform, the dollar exchange rate."
"No maaaaaaa. Faceless is for the one who is shining, not for entry into the judiciary"
The Cyrus Reposter 
"Nobody is interested in Nacho Lozano's explanation..., a thousand times better in ""However"" with Alejandro Pï¿1/2ez Varela and ï¿1/2lvaro Delgado..."
"I believe that they will be more than evaluated and investigated to know their position before the accused and that they do not have that conflict of interest before they judge whoever is going to do it, everything can be done if they act with wisdom and care, but if they are lazy to work any pretext is good,"
"For if so, Ahy no longer there is a guarantee that the person who was chosen as judge is really Ahy ahy cat in the closet"
"What is needed is a jury without faces and that the judge's decision is not in his hands, but in the jury"
Is this reform definitely nonsense?
"Because the sarcas!! That a company does not request employees with minimum requirements. You discredit a request that the majority of the people request. If you are looking for a democratic country, why not respect the opinion of the majority, if this was done before by the PRIAN, because it would be different for Morena.  He considers that MORENA is assigned by the people. This indicates that it is the majority."
Then you are going to vote only for the person's name without knowing their face or how
"In Nuevo León there are legislators without face or body because they have not gone to legislate for 6 months only, we know their party cm or mc I don't even remember anymore."
"Pure circus with these mythologists, hahaha, the reform is fine."
 If you're going to have names just to judge you won't have faces
"I think it's very good, only then are they going to recast those criminals"
"Lower his salary, return him to the extraordinary ones, it is seen that he bought his card"
"And I ask you, do we have justice with the old system?"
The news had to be from these sellouts.
"Plan c is already defined, that's why we voted for Morena from Tamaulipas"
"I hope it's a joke... faceless judges, is a concept in which their participation in the trial is kept secret; nothing more, you will never know who is going to participate in those cases when you vote.
You are welcome!!!"
"The problem is not the game, it is the players."
You already knew it with morena is doing better to the people....!!!
"Another of that my brother that they pass a law and can help all our indigenous family equal to the smallest to the largest so that they do not walk in the streets suffering it is unfair that they are the most beaten mistreated watch that Mexican tribe belongs to one of the 12 tribes of Judah and take care of it so that our nation continues to be blessed by Jesus Christ the king of the Jews and Let us not forget the comforter who is the Holy Spirit, who is powerful and dangerous in the face of injustice. Greetings I hope someday you can see this message and you can pay attention to there are many indigenous people abandoned on the streets"
"Now anyone who buys a degree can be a judge, They don't have to be really forgiven with master's degrees, doctorates that have years of experience and faceless is going to be worse more corruption, how scary it is going to be to fall into the hands of the ""new justice"" that is going to be more sold and corrupt than ever.  The only thing I agree with is to lower the number of years in the service, there are too many and the salary, because the less they earn, the more corruption there are who are going to expose themselves for little."
Useless refers to when there are judges judging cases of organized crime
"But not mms, it says that only organized crime!!"
The presenter will recognize Norma by the body
FACELESS JUDGES PROTECT JUDGES AND IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
"Well, it is well thought out why do you want to know judges who sentence organized crime, it is well thought out not to know them"
"Also that they remove these means of misinformation, they are used to discrediting without grounds that confuse devilish minds."
"You don't need to know his face to know if he will know how to judge well
Only his resume 

Disdain when physical appearance is important to dispense justice "
Let's go 4T
The minimum average should be 10
"It is understood that it is a cyclical periodical, only that in general personnel with guaranteed honesty have to be presented, one thing is the vote and others once elected to judge a highly dangerous delinquent"
"The idea sounds good, the problem is that the judiciary is rotten, an example is recently the death of a low-profile police officer who was murdered in her neighborhood recently, that was a high official but low profile, murdered, there was also the case of the federal judge who was killed when he was in office,  That figure should be chosen by the Senate or not, but it must be very careful but above all audited every year and avoid misusing its power,"
"Nobody knows what this reform is about, but they are supporting it with pure argument. Of those who truly know, there is not a single one who approves of this stupidity."
Do they really think we are so ignorant that we cannot understand what a reform means? Whatever topic it is to be discussed? These individuals do not deserve to step on the ground they walk on.
Friend they will be registered you will know who they are but you will not know which one you liked
"It's only faceless before a trial, for voting you will know who you vote for"
"Dumb!  Faceless judges in trials, not in judges' positions.  Obviously, an already established and appointed judge is going to be a faceless judge so that the criminal does not know who of all the people convicted him.  Image and its misinformation as always wanting to make people foolish."
How reliable is this means of communication?
"they are going to see several judges, but they are not going to have a face in the trials"
"What does it mean that they let the criminal go free and they will no longer have their millionaire privileges, that's why they don't want change, here they cry and the PRIAN did it at will."
The faceless judge will be chosen from those who exist!  For me it is a good idea because they are threatened or bought! YES to the reform of the judiciary! And you didn't explain it well!
"Faceless judges? It can lend itself to bad things, we're already screwed with that now??? I don't have confidence in the system."
Go ahead with plan C and also get rid of multiple
"Hey, the chosen ones are going to see each other, but in the case of a dangerous criminal, he will not know from all the judges who is going to issue the sentence, I think. Or I don't know"
THEY FORGET THAT ZEDILLO REFORMED AND FIRED JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES TO HIS LIKING AND NEED ???? THEY FORGOTTEN????? ....???
"Don't be a fool, to vote ko setian without a face only for when they are judging serious crimes the judge is oraged and I will say not only organized crime are also popular white-collar ones, they have so much power and money that the judges are in danger"
"Sorry for my ignorance, what does it affect me, I am 70 years old"
Enjoy what you voted
It will be Hazar who plays the criminals. From among the elected judges.
The judiciary is filthy. Not even simple things can always be solved by judges and hearings are delayed. I hope it improves because of very bad experiences.
"Mr. communicator, where do I get that in Mexico the expression is an amendment in which country you are"
He cries because he does not receive money from the government as before
It seems that you don't like a brunette 
"I think you're manipulating the information, my friend!!! ï¿1/2"
"What damages the country are corruption, the inefficiency of the magistrates, of all useless people who wash in the MP"
"What are you saying? Even a child will understand that you vote for people with a face, only in case of exercising a judgment they would not do it"
Better put him to give information about the house of the famous because he only knows about politics...
The poor are what prevents us from living
"In reality the people have the right to put in and take away public servants that would be democracy, because then public servants do whatever they want and the law and corruption protects them and blesses them as they come...."
That is called the whim of the president
Well x k so many inconsistencies if what we have had in Mexico x years only serves for rich and powerful we do not lose anything x k morena makes the reforms to the judiciary and we can gain a lot with a balanced justice or k x at least we try
"You have to give it a chance, so that others earn their money, always the same, bad that it will always be like this, they grab the bone they don't let go!"
Poor our Mexico... Venezuela will become the second...
"As they with the dollar, that has nothing to do with the appreciation of the dollar."
Let the race end and that's it
"Don't be a fool, that faceless thing will be when they are judging the criminal"
CHUMEL LOZANO. This character could have been a good journalist but he became a 
"Let him pass the sieve, who knows"
More of the same with this government corruption and more corruption
So those who are have qualifications of excellence academy nee creooo
Please don't misinform
FACELESS JUDGES SHOULD BE ROBOT JUDGES.
"Despite wanting to be liked behind the line, remember that the company is anti-brunette and there is the crazy Ciro and there you go"
A faceless judge cannot blackmail or threaten judges by organized crime.
We don't like you brunette.
They also need to remove the fake news and traitors from the country
"Haha ps of loss with lic.. of 7.5, that the ball of people without studies, who obtained such high positions and without studies, pure recommended..."
"Nacho
When a character of the c o
A judge will be elected, but there will be the ""faceless"" one"
Truncated!? There are quite a few questions about the bottarga!
"The road to hell is made of good intentions. The idea may be good, at least in the United States district attorneys have to earn their position by popular election but they are constantly being evaluated and there are no known cases of institutional corruption, but if something characterizes Mexico it is nepotism and corruption, if in positions of popular political election it happens,  imagine on another level, in short, the hypotenuse."
"For being worthless, mother"
They must also put an end to this kind of peogram that misinforms the people of Mexico and harms society
"You disappoint me Nacho, please!!"
"Even law students understand how dangerous such a reform is for Mexico, in short, Moreno does not think"
But they're going to be watching them
I didn't even see him explaining well
"Amlo wants absolute power, because he is the one who is going to govern, the lady is only his front man, I see a Mexico with inflated prices, with insecurity, with lack of work, where the treasury does not give opportunity to businessmen, on the contrary it makes businesses close every day, taking away employees because companies pay too many taxes,  Where Chinese companies have come to displace local production. The truth is that I don't see a change, on the contrary the country is in a tailspin, and the worst thing is that people believe that for a few pesos that they give them, that will be enough for them to live, what sadness."
"I thought you were a little smarter.
I think you were the only one who didn't understand the hidden face of the judges."
how they come but not as close as they are to the U.S. that even money is from the fideoconfiscates
Dice accusedssss
At least you're serious about giving the information and you're not misrepresenting it
"Don't be w3y3s ""the faceless"" is simply not identifying the vote (against or in favor of the thug) tmb could move the trial to another judicial circuit.
Instead of informing, they are chattering and misinforming the population."
"There is no more erroneous explanation than the one that is raised from Nacho ignorance, the judges will be elected and identified, as pointed out by Alasï¿1/2.. only in the case of organized crime, will it be assigned, of the elected judges, to a judge whose identity will be reserved for his own safety, there are already faceless witnesses in matters of organized crime.  And yes, it may violate fundamental guarantees of due process but the weight of the right to know who is judging you should be weighed against the right to life and integrity of the judge, it is a case of collision of rights that should be debated with its reasons and causes, but it is totally false what you point out to those who will choose faceless judges,  It's real stupidity"
And this thing about the television stations is angry as they can already steal it
"That reform looks good in a first world country, but not here in Mexico, even a son of a drug trafficker could become a judge, Mexico is getting worse and worse, but well we have the government we deserve, my Mexico is turned into a circus of fanaticism and ignorance, but well we already have a better health system than Denmark's,  How much ignorance my beautiful country"
Let them lower their salaries
"I don't know who this change really is, Mr. Sir, your explanation is not serious, you must give context of what this change really is, you need a neutral who makes known what this change really is for the people, I would like to see a Mr. like Jalife, a person very vast in political and geopolitical knowledge, with seriousness and maturity, alien to any government position, the others, whether from a party or others lack all this"
"It consists of Mexico being a militarist dictatorship and López Obrador wants to make a true communist dictatorship very different from the previous one, since although they are democratic countries, these types of dictatorships still exist"
Seriously!??? I didn't understand or it's done to confuse.
"As you will be chayotero, don't be RIDï¿1/2CULO!! Palero of the PRIANISMO, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IT BECAUSE THE REFORM IS GOING !! LONG LIVE THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO!!"
"THIS REFORM AFFECTS THE DAY???? INFORMATION
OR DISINFORMATION??? THIS IS NOT INFORMATION
THIS PROGRAM IS MESSY..."
It is very false this communicator is very false is the typical chilango there are more qualified people who are more capable than this person.
What does the dollar have to stop defending the magistrates judges that they are more harmful to Mexico
It's true that not a country should get into another country or you if your friends get into your life abused daddy
"Far from mocking you, you should be grateful that a possibility opens up for justice to be imparted. That the salary they earn is so disgusting to, on top of that, receive a bribe. On the other hand, if the face is known, security is vulnerable and there will be no justice out of fear. Instead of mocking you, create a better one. Mexico can no longer withstand prisons full of people who are not guilty or are guilty of a crime of laughter. Mexico already needs justice, which was conspicuous by its absence for so many years. Obrador was not God and is not, humanly he did what he could in his period. A man alone could not change so much garbage. He must have made mistakes like every human being. So reflect if you love Mexico."
"The popular vote is idiotic anyway the candidates' positions are pre-selected among the 3 powers in equal parts and they don't even give them tests of knowledge, confidence or psychrome, pure lawyer of 8 like Lenia or Marti Batres 0% capacity but 100% obedience"
"Olles, if the sentences are slimy and absurd and they are well studied, you think that to release a criminal who offers you money you need a lot of study"
"The pluris do not even vote for them, and they do not complain"
"Ciro is already leaving, but he is replaced by his clone, his favorite son."
"Legally in Mexico it is said reform, not amendment, they make you laugh wanting to do the ""cool"""
The presenter only speaks to what he thinks and was not taught to think
A reform is needed
"Don't get your hopes up Nachito, you can't even have your career"
"The dollar goes up and down, it's another thing"
"How ugly to live burned,,,,,"
"Nacho in Italy was used to fight the mafia and it worked, plus they vote but they don't know who is in office"
This thing about the drivers who question is a character who wants to look intelligent but looks bad
Like it's not very bright 
"A chi.... elsewhere, they were sloppy "
Cenadora Citlalli was someone without a face or ghost in her position...
Hahaha you applied the nickname of Daddy you do know Princeeeee 
That is interesting since crime has killed many for acting well
I expected a sensible and impartial analysis... but it clearly seeks to confuse.
Don't stain nacho you just lost an admirer 
"HEY LOZANO PLEASE, THERE IS CURRENTLY AN EXAMPLE OF A DENTIST IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH !! WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW??? BUT SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF ONE OF THE CURRENT MINISTERS SO DON'T MAKE A FOOL OF WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE, YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING"
"You studied your line well, Nachito "
No mms Nacho not because you like the game they will accept you
"If Norma Piï¿1/2a's face had been known, not even the blind vote for her hahaha"
"Yes, this is how the cartel governs in the provinces with this reform even more"
Faceless judges is the stupidest idea of all
"So if I don't finish elementary school, I could be a magistrate and then without a face I could be a total aviator, it remains among us"
"It's not just about brunettes, everyone is welcome, prepared, what it's about is removing so many thieves"
"That my chayoteros are not finishing it up what justice you are talking about the money that the ministers have unfrozen, Genaro's money and others"
"Like faceless, no mmmsss  "
Lie if they know who it is they will be faceless players when they are judging
"It is to avoid the same thing that happens in this type of newscast, because you are the son of a friend's concuvine you put to give news without knowing about the subject and trying to look good with mommy's friend, manipulating the news in his favor, but in the end an expert in a truncated career giving news, you can not ask for anything better for a cheap salary"
at the time of trial
That's why you're a presenter 
"There is nacho I thought you were neutral and I see that you are not to see if the same thing does not happen to you as to the other chayoteros, ciro, lily, etc"
"There's Nacho start reading the reform of the Judiciary, you'll really read with you"
Estie01/2 Mal Ace Dancing
Too many for the little they do
You talk because nacho has a voice
"MEXICO LIBRE, OUT WITH THE YANKEES AND CAPITALISTS, LONG LIVE AMLO, LONG LIVE MORENA AND OUT WITH COCA COLA, WALMART, ALL THOSE CAPITALIST COMPANIES OUT
AMLO MAKE IT POSSIBLE SOCIALISM WE TRUST YOU AMLO"
 3 days
"As pathetic as all those who come to defend the president, and this one to top it all off feels nice."
Teach this driver how the judicial reform is going to be because he is only talking about nonsense.
I like you Nacho and it's better that if you're not working better don't give your opinion... 2 I hope that if you go to Teleriza you don't tell lies like the ciro
"Use logic, my dear sonso, there is no way that they are going to take revenge against all the judges."
Ignorant nachito think it was but alive
"There is a tray, the court will not know them, not the voters and the charolo thing not to call you vandejo"
" what kind of communicator is this, who did not understand what faceless judges refer to and in what context. I think it would be very silly to explain it to him hahahaha"
"AMLO said that he was not going to remove a period or a comma from the constitution,
They are chayoteros, that's why they say that the reform is going to be carried out"
"No mames nacho, they mean that it is not known which judge is the one who is judging you when the crime is of the narcos, for obvious reasons."
"Well, it will seem like a joke what he says but it is the truth pure recommended of brunette is going to enter they want to have absolute power "
Ha ha ha!!! The faceless May!! .. circus and more circus....
You should inform you should have a circus 
And when Mexico stuck its nose in Ecuador k?
And you disagree 
How crude that..
"Nacho do not contribute to the assumptions of by itself there is a lot of ignorance and laziness to investigate what the reform is and what it is about and you come out with that it will be only because they are ""brown"" and they will already give them a chance to the contest? Don't you see that the ""borrrepericada"" go and repeat things without foundation?"
"Hey Nacho, and before how they chose them by finger, by compadrazgo, by friends, whether they had or did not have an education, then don't say anything else, if they liked a brunette before, even if they didn't like the pri and the bread, but they were their buddies"
This driver is very stupid. He is explaining a reform that he does not even understand because he does not read it. Do me the favor ! 
"You were fine until you said a nonsense, it's about fighting corruption,"
PURE CAJETA YOUR INFORMATION!
So they only vote when they want to no that the people rule hahahaha pure and finger to the country
What a delay another chayote
"Nacho how you like to confuse people who don't catch up more than you do. Faceless judges will only be faceless, for the trial of organized crime, that is, it will not be known who the person is. But to choose them, they all need to show their faces. I don't think you don't understand, you'll be too innocent, not even a primary school kid anymore. You do it with all intent. How disastrous your case..."
"You're half pombe nachito?!? They will be faceless judges, once elected!!"
But this Nacho always takes away our bad moods
"You say pure, the faceless judges will be elected and already appointed in an election and ratified, only in the case of a trial procedure for those accused of organized crimes, as it will be avoided to make known the identity of this judge already appointed.  ."
They should inform me I see them to laugh for a while to know that they are already 0 creative to speak ill of their father Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
"the president asked for respect because they have nothing to do with it in Mexico is independent.
apply in accordance with the requirements.
You are right-wing and it will not be those of Morena who choose."
"You are part of the above, it is noticeable from leagues."
"It's hard to explain, it's hard to understand

he proceeds to opine nonsense"
The regime does not moan
Half a year but it goes
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THEY ARE FUN BUT VERY SHODDY.
Now it will be more expensive.. pay to know which Judge you have to do and then bribe him
This boy in a short time will be a copy of Ciro Gï¿1/2mez Leyva. It's flying. Time to time.
The Claudian Rooster
Super zezgado that guy nacho lozano
Announcer spokesperson of the dictatorship
Because they don't return him... For the shit
Average of 9 always 8 is mediocrity
"FIRST THE FACELESS ARE CHOSEN AND THEN THEY ARE CLASSIFIED, DON'T GO OVERBOARD"
The fifis have fun with lies
It's not a rhyme don't deceive
"Nacho, even if they explain to you how you are going to understand him, you need to get deeply involved in these tasks, you take a bouquet of red roses to your comadre la Piï¿1/2ata so that she can explain to you I believe her if you understand her"
Semete USA and Canada because it has grasshoppers in Mexico

"Well, don't stain, don't stain, because the world ends"
"You are under observation, do your job well"
"Incite hatred, ask yourself to explain without being TENDENTIOUS... avoid MEDIOCRITY..."
The driver looked half pen
"Nacho you have to be more objective, not because you are a sympathizer you are going to be a judge. Magistrate, etc. You're used to corruption, that's why you talk like that."
"Trying to be funny, Nacho went on to simplistic and misrepresent. Lamentable"
The reform is going to
"It seems that you were already trained to be the
New Cyrus"
"The brute himself is saying it, only in cases of organized crime"
ONLY RETROGRADES AND OPPONENTS REJECT HEALTHY REFORMS!
This little guy is badly signed
"Because they're always trying to fool the audience. It is not possible for them to give such absurd explanations.  How do you call yourself journalists? First inform yourself and make true and honest statements and leave your mockery and mockery for other types of programs.   Because in this way it is not possible to classify them as serious journalists.   If you want to be heard, change the way you report, have ethics and honesty in everything you say"
Pure sensationalism
How he lies!!
Don't make it up...... I thought it was really your article!!
The problem is that the same people gave power to that old man so that he can make it happen
Tyrant channel news image against Mexico
"Don't lie, it's not like that. You are misinformed, you look very Loret de Mola style with those statements"
"This guy is the same as his preference, he doesn't know whether to say things as they are, or to be a real chayotero"
A judge will be chosen from the mountain and no one will know who it is Don't be so cool
"This compa only informs what suits him, how bad"
Nachito is your little boss Salinas Pliego? Always incados and crouched complying for a little salary if they are not run by their patron.
No mames gï¿1/2ey bien sabes k la reforma si asse falta
Don't be Pen. Sativa you already said it alone they will not know who sentenced them.
A new chayotero
Don't suck all the foolish things you say. Why America's Faceless Judges Are Not Critical
Hahaha how much did I pay you the prian for your words
Damn dude still doesn't understand and you're already encouraging the corruption
"But how thoughtful you are, you had to represent your conservative media that is only against the current government, nefarious"
Were this chayoterito going well but by playing funny did I spoil it?
Ciro Gomez Leyva's son has spoken hahaha an analysis on the reform should be serious not cyclical greetings !!
"You already look like brush, don't stain, I thought you were smarter, Nachito"
Now tell me about Adriï¿1/2n Marcelo your cover
San Martin and this young man are formed by the right so that
"There are rumors that Nacho is a possible replacement for Ciro Gï¿1/2mez Leyva not playing!! Nacho is a funny communicator in the style of Videragay or the stake, from Guatemala to Guateoeor be serious !!"
Comments full of banana republic fans.... Iuuuuuu
"Gossip that you are to have ATI give you a position, and see your face and the government has to be aware of the work of all of them if not then there is no law or justice out of fear."
"This guy is a bit slow even a primary school child could deduce it, this guy as a good TV Azteca worker only seeks to misinform"
You follow your Nacho Chayotero
"every time you disappoint me more and more Nacho.... well aligned.. Last.. another one who surely tells him ""either you fall in line or you go"""
"Don't be a clown, you don't have to be in favor of morena, there are people from other parties"
"Don't be an idiot when it comes to an accusation against some mafioso or some public servant with power in the government, obviously there must be someone faceless to avoid reprisals"
THE CHAYOTEROS HAVE ALREADY STARTED JSJSJSJS
"Are you or are you made??? Your father Cyrus told you to say that???? We have our own opinion, you don't need to screw up by misinforming."
"So young and that your journalism is at the service of the financial oligarchy and conservatism, the new consciousness is being built up is because of your fiction"
Is anyone else bothered by the silly way that nacho communicates?
This poor guy is pitiful
This reporter is still drunk
Liars!
It's okay 8 I had very intelligent companions of 9 and 10 but to exercise they are very brute
The chayotito
"That's not true, nacho lozano, don't say and don't suck the bugle."
Ask the commentator for zero for being a brute
"Did you hear that right? Did you say amendment? That is, an American term."
You are in countries children ...!!
How silly that faceless officials but anyway what occurrences
"What distorted and out of the realm of information, first studies the reform and then explains"
"Obviously they have faces and names when choosing them, but when it comes to resolving trials related to drug trafficking, the identity of one of the several selected will be covered, it is something totally logical and correct, in the end this video seems the opinion of a clown trying to make people laugh about an important issue ???"
What's up with this guy? They have already hired him of those who are going to spend 6 years and the government?
They will also really set up journalists who misreport
We cannot do worse than we suffer today with that judiciary
The accused
Just like a chorus Gï¿1/2mez Leyva with reason you are the substitute for your lying godfather in everything
Rste nacho is also an allologist like zochicles PKM
"Your comments are terrible LORETITO not at all congruent, it's logical you bring the lord school montages "
"You're very funny,"
Pï¿1/2ngale 0
"I didn't know that this journalist was a political analyst and expert in reforms, so let it be legislated, right?  Better make jokes as you know how to do it, let the adults work."
"Pure lies from this channel, not as they put it "
"Hahaha and even if you can see their faces they are still crooked, they let themselves be carried away by the highest bidder"
"You are worse than the child, we will vote for the judges but we will not know which of the 1500 will be in charge of judging organized crime criminals, you really don't understand? Or you become a pend.... the net..."
Hey sarcastic informant emulation of chumel that you will like from 7 D 8 D9.
Laugh your opinion
"This poor guy who thinks he's funny, no one believes him."
"This chayoterito was doing well, but he wanted to be funny and began to say nonsense"
Pure ignorance of this journalist .according to him knows what he is saying..
Do not misinform.
Burlï¿½n.
"You vote with a face but already inside all those registered become faceless, you don't deviate too much"
You are very menso
Let them punish the lying journalists sold out that's why I don't watch news on TV I'd better change it to movies I only watch news on you tube
"That Nacho you are of the kind you can expect, that's why no one watches your broadcast hahaha"
"DON'T SUCK ANYTHING TO DO WITH FOREIGNERS, FOREIGNERS ARE WORTH IT."
Estas bien menso neta
You're bouncing for knowledge. Not because of a pretty face.
"Minimum information before talking about a topic, talk to. Assumptions are the most aberrant and unobjective"
How fifi do you look Nacho
"This son of Lopez Doriga and Alaraki is more endejo than a grandson,"
"They already gave you the script, no information"
"That judges are voted for by the citizenry but that the accused does not know who his judge is

But

that if people who belong to organized crime know it, it is obvious that it will lend itself a lot to abuse of power and silence people who are against the future regime"
What a bad job you do
"You know what this explanation is about, it's like the burning ex softening well of his ex hahaha"
"These pseudo-journalists think that we are going to be the same as them that many of them entered with levers and did not even study, they are only actors"
This guy thinks he's very cynical about his stupidity on a subject that's too serious
And the other paleros hahahahaha but I'm not going to see it they design hahahahaha
Damian and Almaguer are very professional as they want our country
"I'm on the left, but that doesn't mean I hate those who don't think like me.
And this senator Dami¿1/2n Zepeda I think is one of the sanest and most sane that the opposition has"
I'm your fan Hamlet Almaguer 
"That's how all the deputies should be, not sold out like the majority and with a lot of ignorance only raises fingers, Damiï¿1/2n and Almaguer my respects congratulations"
Damian is another fart. He should be leader of the bread
"I totally agree Damiï¿1/2n, we do not want a single absolute power to remain"
"Very good Juan you can always tell how balanced it is! both very good speakers,"
"I like Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda's constructive language. It is time to build and not to confront. Hopefully there will be more citizens who will join the construction of better public policies, and stop listening to all those legislators who only seek to confront and destroy"
"That is why we are as we are, and this Mr. Damian ratifies it, there is no opposition in Mexico, we are well screwed."
"Being a Lopez-Obradorist, I recognize that Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda is one of the few redeemable elements of the PAN. He is not a slum dweller and shouted like Kenya, and he has shown that he has autocritique towards his party."
"I am not a PAN member, nor do I share his ideals, however, Damiï¿1/2n is a TRUE OPPOSITION. He is a prepared person and he is the opposition that is needed."
"Damian Zepeda urges him to distance himself from the PAN and form a party that is a real opposition 
Those of us who believe in the 4th will be at the forefront of this battle but we want a worthy opposition"
"Deputy Hamlet Almaguer is right, we are doing well with our 4T Viva Mexico"
"Hamlet is an expert in electoral matters and constitutional law, he makes the issue of judicial reform very clear."
Hamlet A. The best constitutionalist today. Full support for the 4 T. Damiï¿1/2n recognizes that they have done very badly.
"I love the debate with professionals.
Hamlet very coherent. 
Damian Zepeda too. 
And the driver Juan Becerra!!"
"Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda is one of the best that the opposition has, he speaks with idea and knowledge. It is even a pleasure to listen to it. Up with the 4T informed and analytical. Mexico has already woken up. ??"
Too bad! Dami¿1/2n Zepeda is very intelligent! Too bad he's in the worst game!
We are with Morena.
"LISTENING TO THESE 2 GUESTS DEBATE LIKE THIS IS A DELIGHT....... ONE IS A SENATOR, VERY SENSIBLE AND VERY INTELLIGENT, THE OTHER IS A VERY BRILLIANT DEPUTY AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE LAW, WELL......... THESE 2 ARE AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH DEBATES BETWEEN POLITICIANS FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES SHOULD BE........ A GREAT SUCCESS BY JUAN BECERRA TO HAVE INVITED THEM............. ONE EVEN WANTS TO LISTEN TO THEM FOR A WHILE."
"The abuse is what the PRIAN did for decades, not constitutionally touching institutions that were ineffective and inefficient just because their family and friends worked there. Mexico is no longer to be complacent with anyone, they give results they stay, they do not give results with the penalty but they leave,  That is what the judicial reform offers the Mexican population and that is why the people support it. And the PAN is the one who can least talk about abuses when from one day to the next they sent thousands of Luz y Fuerza workers to the streets. It seems that for them we have first, second and third class Mexicans."
"Very good DAMIï¿1/2N I'm with Tigo, "
"Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda has the same narrative as Ricardo Anaya, pure blah, blah, blah, and when it comes down to it, he says NO to everything."
No to the disappearance of autonomous organisms
Mexico needs a leader like Zepeda
"Very good Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda, from a Morenita % sanity and coherence above all"
If justice and the judiciary need a change and the first change has to be to remove all the magistrates and judges and then make the necessary adjustments to make it a better justice.
"Damian, I congratulate you for showing that a PAN member, politicized, and not domesticated, because saying no to everything, because justice, is what you say, a person who imparts justifies, has to be, truthful, sinsero, fair and legal, congratulations, because you are not, tamed, you are politicized, may God bless you."
"The lawyer almaguer as always very punctual and precise in his dialogues, congratulations."
"My respects to Damian, he represents a dignified Right with arguments. Without insults and insults. Hopefully one day in Mexico we will have a respectable opposition."
"Fight against corruption? It will be in another country, but in Mexico it is not like that!"
"We need legislators like Damian to solve serious problems of our nation, Mexico needs honest and intelligent people long live Mexico lives??"
"From the overrepresentation and the PRD Senators, the politicians are losing credibility, but we totally agree that we do NOT want a Judicial Branch subordinated to any political party."
The problem is that they want only absolute power and we don't agree with them
"Because the idea of the reform ??? If the same corrupt people stay, we will remain the same, here we are talking about corruption"
"I love Hamlet and Dami, professional people with whom you can really debate, doing work to be able to move the country forward, I wish and that's how the rest of the opposition would work"
"Hamlet an excellent defender of the people, there is generational change "
"BRAVE  
EXCELLENT GUESTS"
"THE MEDICAL TREATMENT IS VERY POOR, THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EQUIPMENT"
"He is crazy about the medical service, that there are no medicines, they do not have state-of-the-art medical instruments, good devices that are required, specialists have resigned many for lack of payment"
And these media chayoteros can only cry.
The citizen does see it as good that the reform is applied to the Judiciary
Hamlet masterfully argues
"Juan and Ruiz Healy are the only ones in the form of a formula who are not typical of us in their way of conducting and moderating the discussion table.

Ciro. Lï¿1/2pez Doriga, among others. "
Damian Cepeda is against the people is going to end up like Alito
How great is the leader of Morena Amlet Almaguer
"PRACTICAL ""PADLOCKS"" ARE REQUIRED TO PREVENT ABUSE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE CRIMES OF PERJURY AND EMBEZZLEMENT."
"For the good of all, the Lopez Beltrï¿1/2n first"
"I like to see these debates between thinking and civilized people, I congratulate them!"
"Hamlet excellent person, and very knowledgeableï¿1/2 and always very eloquent and balanced!!"
You Mr. Damian know perfectly well that this is not how the judiciary works
"DAMIAN. YOU ARE A DECENT PERSON. 40,000 LIGHT AND POWER WORKERS FROM THE CENTER RAN THEM OUT. YOU. AND LIKE THAT. THERE ARE MORE OUTRAGES. DO NOT STAIN. RESPECT YOURSELF"
Damiï¿1/2n Zapeda and Mr. Halmaguer very coherent in their participation.
"THESE DEBATES ARE CONSTRUCTIVE 
THAT'S HOW DEMOCRATIC LIFE SHOULD BE"
"Without a doubt, one of the best debates on the issue of the judiciary, said by Damiï¿1/2n, I don't agree at all, but the discussion in general is not violating the constitution.... and it is that Almaguer said it before that this reform will have 3 years to mold the controversies and in general discussions of judicial order so that the 3 powers in their competence are delimited is when congratulations to the 2 panelists"
"He is the only decent and honest senator of the opposition, Dami¿1/2n Zepeda congratulated him"
"My respect for Senator Damian Zepeda for being one of the few opposition members who does not follow decisions or orders from his parties forced or blindly (as in Morena they are doing and they give the reason to those who call them the new PRI), so in my opinion, that is the opposition that Mexico deserves,  clarified that in general I support the coalition of Morena and allies in their majority, so I differ and see many mistakes that they have made"
"Good morning All of you, because at minute 1:01 what Mr. Almaguer said stops being heard"
"Everyone knows that the judiciary cannot suspend something that corresponds only to the legislative branch. That piï¿1/2a-ta is not measured and it is overdone, but it is going to be pellellated."
"Dami¿1/2n Zepeda has the key to a real opposition, one that moves away from the PAN"
That the people elect them is the sovereign of the past.
"Damian sometimes looks like he flirts with brunette, but can he be the Trojan horse?"
BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO Senator Almaguer
"It is good to read all these kinds of discrepancies among people, the product of a country divided by politicking."
"Both very professional, respectful and objective, hopefully all politicians are like them."
"Well, do you know how it is in Dinï¿1/2mica?"
To see a distinguished opponent speak with a little common sense is hopeful. Congratulations Mr. Becerra. Thank you Hamlet. It is rare to see opposing oppositions but with respect.
"Yes, but he's on the wrong side"
"Damien's position with respect and a posture of respect for Hamlet's position, very good assertion of the two, Damien will be a very valuable element in Morena."
Damián Zepeda is a lot of piece for that lackey of autocracy.
What happened at 1:03 in the video? Why did they not want to leave the name he gave?
"Let's go for plan C because that's why we voted 
And we don't need the votes of the paniaguados we are a majority that they leave, we don't occupy them"
"HAMLET, FROM WHICH school are you a graduate, also from the ""Cï¿1/2SPIDE"" INSTITUTE?"
THEM HAMLET!! THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY IS GOING!!
"Hamlet is a young man with a lot of strength, intelligence and preparation"
"Painfully and objectively, Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda is right."
"Thus, valid and honest arguments must be debated politely. Although the Morena party failed to recognize that our health system does not reach Denmark even a little bit. Tache x that. Otherwise excellent. I am not a PAN or Moreno member but I love Damian Zepeda."
Zepeda wants to be in Morena 
Name I was surprised with Dami¿1/2n I am from Morena but that is precisely the opposition that we need a critical opposition I mean we only have a vermin ball
I am a Morenista but my respects for this man Damian Zepeda very analyst very prudent Damian Zepeda you are in the wrong party come for Morena
"Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda should invite Susana Prieto to make an opposition party; it is not a matter of saying NO to everything, but neither of saying YES without analyzing pros and cons.  It seems to me that together they will make a real counterweight, not to throw at the government, but to improve what is being done. Best regards."
This journalist is more of a palero of the river
Put on the icing on the cake Damian stop trying to convince marko
We no longer want corrupt judges....... What are you afraid of...?????
"Let Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda explain, what he has done x Mexico, how his work has been reflected in the well-being of Mexicans, considering that that is what we pay him for, as well as this Alito, Marco and other politicians"
"Congratulations Almaguer, you are a complete man, you do your job wonderfully, just by seeing you once and hearing you you SEE THE QUALITY?"
"The political parties forget that the people elected them as representatives, not as legal proxies so that in our name they dictate, make or transgress rights or make changes in the Constitution in our name and less for the benefit of their ill-gotten ego. They are volatile candidates, they are the highest bidder"
Great voices for debate
You were very soft Damiï¿1/2n.... The lies of this government cannot be covered with a finger... and even less so in terms of health..... you have to be tough with these guys who only know how to lie....
"Damian Zepeda, for months I have seen all your presentations in the different forums, despite having voted for all these changes for the reasons that you yourself have had the courage to expose, I have to amply recognize you for being so Honest and Democratic despite how you say it, not being this for your convenience,  should the PAN support you as a true counterweight of very respectable opinions, the new opposition would have another history and not its current reality"
The. Laws in the constitution should be clearer
It is a mockery of the lies of Lopez Obrador
"How sad that characters who praise for their study and knowledge, know that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has already had a pronouncement on the separation of judges, as it is now intended to do with the reform of the judiciary."
No to Judicial Reform
"To show that you know about the law, is not to get angry, shout, raise your voice, and throw a tantrum! Damián Zepeda you are an excellent politician. Not to mention the other guy."
"Law students, listen to this and learn, Damiï¿1/2n and Hamlet, bread and brunette, but in a correct analysis and with a lot of truth."
8:51 It's not just seeing gentleman. It is to discuss it.
You can't change Mexico by doing a short memory abuse
"1994 in the Official Gazette of the Federation amended 27 of the 136 articles of the Constitution and 
introduced provisions relating to the integration of the judicial powers of the entities.
The appointment of the head of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic, the creation of the system 
and, most notably, the organization and powers of the 
of the Judicial Branch of the Federation. 
The main features of the reform in the field of federal justice were, on the one hand, the 
creation of the Federal Judiciary Council as the body responsible for the administration of the Federal Judiciary 
and oversight of the federal courts and, on the other hand, the redesign of the structure and powers 
of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation to make it a more compact and compact body. 
influential, devoted in essence to the resolution of issues involving the interpretation of 
of the Federal Constitution. The modifications to its structure and integration consisted of the 
reduction from 26 to 11 in its number of members, the definition of a new method for its 
appointment and a fixed term of 15 years or 2 in office. These modifications are made up of
complemented by others that significantly expanded their competences in the field of
constitutional control through the configuration of instruments similar to those they possess 
the constitutional courts and tribunals of other countries."
"I work in a hospital and the health system is terrible. There are no supplies to work, medicines and lack of personnel."
"Zepeda ï¿1/2s good politician but he is too much I would say two faces not to offend but he sees or thinks what suits him, for example before the elections his refrain was WE MUST SAVE MEXICO FROM OBRADOR WHO IS DESTROYING IT as it did not work, he no longer says it, when the overrepresentation,  He said that it was an illegal overrepresentation when he himself knows that it is not true that they are the rules imposed by his party and the PRI and that for several elections it was done that way but now that Morena won he did not like it. And today it is that ministers, judges etc should not be appointed by the people."
Very good debate with arguments.
"The meaning given by the constituents by the legislature and above all the Motto of General Vicente Guerrero: the homeland comes first, as well as the theme of Emiliano Zapata: land and freedom, health and school; as well as other slogans Since it is about taking away judicial independence along with the judicial career, which supports and helps the defense of the rights and guarantees of Mexican citizens, call it the people."
HAHA GREETING THAT THE OLD FILTH COMES TO ACAPULCO TO SEE HOW WE ARE...
What he should discuss is what the hell they are going to do with his reventador de monreal who was unanimously elected by Morena and allies 
"Hamblet a great lawyer and honest human being. 
Damian is a talkative and untrustworthy."
"It is supposed that they are starting their management from day on, where the proposals should be analyzed and voted on this Judicial Reform is not just anything, they do not listen to everyone both in favor and opponents, it is urgent to get this Modification out? Do not forget legislators who owe themselves to the country......"
They can't do it because their owner has already demanded that they do it and they have to do it. Voting is free 
"Don't rub it, doubt that we are better off than Denmark in terms of health...!! the great leader said it!! and ï¿1/2l HE DOES NOT LIE, DOES NOT STEAL AND DOES NOT BETRAY, so to believe, to believe.!!"
"THE LEADER OF A COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE ""WISDOM"" AND THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE HIMSELF IN A ""DIVERSITY"" OR DELIMIT THE POWERS OF EACH ORGAN OF POWER AND COMBINE THEM FOR A BETTER FUNCTIONING OF THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT."
"Go to Mexicali and at least here, my president is not wrong in saying that and we are better off economically for the same place"
"Who made the reforms that impoverished Mexico with the complacency of the judiciary? Now we have the judicial reform to improve justice in Mexico at the door. Now the SCJN is pulling out the nails. Do the judges represent the Executive and the Legislative? Can the best lawyer in Mexico tell me if a judge, magistrate or minister is empowered to annul a reform?"
"Good for the opinions, only that the Deputies must fulfill what they promised and vote for the reform of the decadent judiciary."
"Damian, it's good that you recognize that in Morena there are people who are very prepared to be able to debate"
"Damián Zepeda is the most coherent opposition politician, if that way of thinking was held by the entire opposition, it would be another issue."
"Damián Zepeda should already resign from the PRI and go to Morena, because he is a moderate and coherent politician."
IN HERMOSILLO WE DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE ONLY PAIN CONTROL CLINIC AT THE IMSS
"Damián Zepeda, said well, allying PRI and PAN was a big mistake, for both parties. From that day on I knew that he was an intelligent man and he had to listen to himself."
"The health sector in this six-year term was the worst, and President López Obrador says that it is better than Denmark, someone explain to me."
Congratulations Damian cepeda always congruent
"Just as the moderate left exists, so does the moderate right. My respects to Mr. Zepeda."
ABUSING AND PRETENDING AND LYING AS IF I WERE HIGH!! IT DOES NOT DO MEXICO ANY GOOD!!.
"By making things clear to the PJ, the SCJN and the right-wingers, and clarifying the independence of the power of the Legislature, so that it goes ahead with the 4T and Plan C
Deputy Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda is the most redeemable thing from the PAN"
"My heart is on the left side, but Dami¿1/2n Zepeda is the opposition that this country needs, the best thing is that they put Xochitl a very good candidate."
"Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda, the only PAN member in the world that I respect."
These are debates. Both respectful 
"Like when the oil and electricity reform was made, they left something to appear"
"Deputy Almager reminds Monreal who does NOT want to PROSECUTE tyrant judges, art. 39; 135 of the Constitution and 61 of the Amparo Law. But then for a Reform of the Judiciary if they are going to CONTINUE with agreements."
"There should not ALWAYS be a way to challenge ""something"", it would be contrary to legal certainty."
"The honorable example that there can be a serious, respectful opposition that does not use cheating and lies to win! If he were the president of the PAN they would have the hope of redeeming themselves "
It is a right of workers to have the remedy of amparo and free expression to express what is wrong and of their president and legislators to listen to them
According to the bases are Placed in health in construction of the clinics let's wait and FOLLOW UP THAT I DO NOT DOUBT SO IT WILL BE
DAMIAN ZEPEDA..... WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE COUNTRY????? .... LEADERS LIKE YOU ARE REQUIRED IN THE OPPOSITION 
"Exactly, you don't change by abusing and they abused, laughed and mocked with their reforms when they were the majority, now they don't like the reform anymore because the majority of the people wanted it that way easily"
Damiï¿1/2n cï¿1/2mbiate a morena will do more than in the PAN and would be useful to help so much in the party
"If the deputies, senators and the president of Mexico are elected by the people, why are the judges, magistrates and ministers not? Are they kings, untouchable emperors or what? There must be judicial reform because the people are the ones who rule and we gave the power to the legislators to carry it out. Reform yes."
"The people, full support for the 4T"
"Very good both exponents. I think that in health we are screwed, but not only in this government but in all previous ones. Hopefully Claudia will become less bad this health system"
"There is no abuse, the people voted for judicial reform and the vote of June 2 demonstrates it. Now it turns out that we are going to do what the minority says."
Excellent Hamlet
Damian should leave the PANï¿1/2 he has good ideas but unfortunately he must follow what his leader says!!
I call that dialogue
Zepeda is one of the few PAN legislators who is really respectful of the laws.
"Damian, what is desired is to eliminate the judges and ministers who are blocking the reforms that Mexico needs, that is the core of the judicial reform,"
And the abuses of the judiciary ???
"From the right-wingers they can have some light of hope with these signs of congruence, too bad that they are very few on one hand and many fingers are left over."
"The reform is fair and necessary.obio will be perfected in the points that do not work as they should be, but for now remove all the exesos and get to work."
Long live brunette
"With that attitude, judges reveal what they really are, so they twist the law."
Good debate to learn with arguments
Hamlet Garcï¿1/2a A left-handed chairo and Damuan Zepeda very focused
Dami'n didn't even dare to debate with Hamlet.
I don't answer if it was better than Denmark !! They live in a surrealityï¿1/2 but that's how we are
Why do they remove the sound
"It is a reform, very hasty, in 7 months it cannot be done, in a way, as the federal executive, Andrés López Obrador wants. No to the reform of the judicial power of the Federation. Atte. Agustï¿1/2n Mendoza Mendoza. From Querï¿1/2taro, Qro. Thank you. No to haste."
"So when injustice ends, if there is no reform we need reform"
I like your program very much especially when you invite real politicians two young politicians like these two gentlemen my respects for each of them I am brunette and I am very happy to see these devates and I would even tell damian sepeda that he walks with the wrong brand We invite him to reflect is human To make mistakes and also to rectify is a good bad politician Influenced change would please you to Your Fam.and the Mexican people were assured by these politicians if they contribute to good governments with positive results in all areas.
"Mr. Zepeda in all his political career, has never defended the rights of the citizens of the country, he was simply satisfied with approving what his party dictates to him, the bread and today he calls himself a democrat when he has always been an opportunist"
"These PAN members always putting their hair in the soup that they don't think it's not the way, BUT then PROPOSE A REAL PROPOSAL don't just spend your time OBJECTING AND CRITICIZING for that THEY ARE PAID AND VERY WELL TO CONTRIBUTE IDEAS BUT THEY ARE USED TO NOT THINKING AND ONLY OBJECTING TO EVERYTHING ABOUT MORENA."
"If the PAN members were more intelligent, they would put Damián Zepeda as president of their party, he is a good politician."
"Damian Zepeda, one of the few PAN members who is a pleasure to listen to, may have a very different point of view, but he does it in a way that is respected"
"Hamlet is from Morena and they don't listen, they only blame previous governments and since I can't stand any of Morena anymore,"
"Damian Sepeda is in my opinion an excellent politician ! I am from the left, I am a people, but you have to recognize when a player from the other team is good! Two excellent politicians in this debate!"
"During the Government of Andrés Manuel, the opposition was all the time opposing any proposal, without discussing them or giving their proposal, simply not emphatic, today that the water came up to their necks they begin to say things without support, still today they have the opportunity to give their points of view to the proposals of Constitutional Laws and discuss them in plenary,  providing ideas in the plenary, but they continue to focus on the complaint and do not bring any benefit to the proposals of the Government of the Republic"
"Damian, don't confuse or want to look good with everyone, defining yourself is the best"
"Senator Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda, you can't be so technical in front of rude people who have the referee on their side"
"They did not appeal the suspension, so they consented to it. If they rape her, they commit crimes."
"OH, DAMIï¿1/2N!! WE GO BACK TO THE SAME THING: THEY GO TO COMMISSIONS, they allege everything, the MCPRIAN ""do not propose ANYTHING"", they go to the plenary and they vote everything against."
He is disappointed with health and people applaud him
"Damian sees for morena, it would do the party good"
"""You can't make a change by committing an abuse""
The biggest change in this country was made by abusing the law, so the revolution that I don't think taking up arms was foreseen in the constitution at that time."
A PEOPLE CANNOT BE ABUSED WITHOUT REAL CHANGE..... it reads better...
"In security, as citizens, we know who the bad guys are, destabilizing, hopefully they will not continue with their dirty war and vindicate themselves."
"MARIO, WHAT HAPPENS WITH MONTREAL AND NORO???

I'M SURPRISED.. THE PRIAN WOULD NOT HAVE FORGIVEN THEM
TOMORROW THEY WILL VOTE FOR PLAN C???
OF COURSE NOT

IF THE LAWSUIT IS ALREADY THERE. HÏ¿1/2WIN IT 
HAVE WILL 
FIND A CHICKEN
IT'S MEXICO WHO DISRESPECTS HIM 
MEXICANS FAIL"
"If they had debated him for a month in the Senate, in the chambers, in the media, in national forums, Zedillo would have done it when in three days he changed the entire supreme court."
"Because of this vision that Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda has, they do not let him grow in bread.
It is one of the most congruent that there is in bread.
 I think their different points of view are well argued... Even though they obviously do not go with the ideology of the 4T."
"The abuse that the PAN did for a long time, does NOT mean that Morena is going to do the same, it is like comparing Salinas and his boss Calderón with AMLO is a lot of difference"
WE ARE 6 LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM DENMARK'S HEALTH SYSTEM
"Zepeda, don't disappoint me."
The driver will be a very strong disciple of the brotherhood based in Guadalajara ¡pura luz!
"If Zepeda were in Morena he would be great, but even ""he could be the right one to form a serious position, even if sometimes going against him wins."
"Abusing whom,... because that rotten judiciary has abused the people of Mexico and its institutions for decades"
"A PROPOSAL TO LEO ZUKERMAN: INVITE IN YOUR PROGRAM THE TIME TO ""CRITICIZE"" HAMLET ALMAGUER, JULIETA RAMÍREZ AND MANUEL PEDRERO. IMPOSSIBLE, IT WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES."
"Damian gets stubborn, he can't even with Markititito.... Give it hard Hamlet, long live the 4T...."
"Damian that ""the markito"" cortez does not carry you between his legs. Act wisely and do not act deliberately. Don't be manipulated by those who betrayed the people"
"Mr. Hamlet, I wish that the knowledge you have would be applied to positive actions, but it is embarrassing that you support such idiocies, that is to be retrigrade and vile."
"Even though he is the most ""conciliatory"" of the PAN, he does not say why the reform will be harmful."
"I understand why the students make this opposition not represent them that is botched and they think like this softie....  Whether you are right or not, you have to support the position because that is what Morena does even if they are wrong.... He asks to defend this reform in the chamber seeking that majority to change its vote.... how naïve.... Don't be silly, Damián Zepeda"
"Now he defends the SCJN he says that it is not fair, to defend so many benefits and the liberation of so many influential liberating and returning so many millions and it seems ""fair"" to him when they approved the reform of peï¿1/2a in how long he approved it and he did not put buts and now he speaks very fair (with moche) we voted for Plan C"
The bases are already there does not mean that the IMSS is ready as the humble man who lives in a Palace assures
"That zepeda is very haughty, but it doesn't make much ado about nothing."
"I am from Morena and I understand the problem but I consider that a reform of the judiciary is needed but not as it is being proposed, at the same time I consider that the reform as it is being given will be a great mistake."
"Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda you are a well-born person, of values, principles and preparation, this Hamlet does not even reach your heels, nefarious as his puppeteer, traitors are in their blood."
"The PAN members are very loud ,,,,,it is part of their complexes and incapacity"
"On the issue of health I do not agree, in the hospitals, that is, in the health centers there are not even improvements, it is the truth plainly, let's be serious and one, of humans it is to be recognized that in terms of health but especially in the issue of security we are very bad."
"Damian Zepeda should have been the candidate, not the fucking botarga they put"
"The Opposition has been criticizing and putting Amparos and obstacles to all the Proposals of the Executive for the 6 years of AMLO, and reality showed that they were wrong in everything! Why should we listen to them now with the issue of the Court? AMLO's Plan C total support !"
It is not unconstitutional but unconventional
"If the opposition were congruent as Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda would be in another situation, talking with people who listen is very different, what a pity that the rest of the opponents are small mental."
"Damian should be the leader of the opposition, but not before purging or even distancing himself from the prehistoric parties."
"National Action is worth pure VGA I tell you from Baja California someone who voted for Ernesto Ruffo Appel, a change without abuse... 
They always abused without any change."
"Hamlet Almaguer does not know Constitutional, as they see it, of course the Constitutional Reform can be challenged based on its independence and its autonomy in relation to human rights, amen."
"Totally in favor of taking away pharaonic salaries and benefits from judges. I also agree that there should be a disciplinary board, which puts in jail judges who stop trials for influence, corruption."
Brincate a morena
I like Damiï¿1/2n doesn't scream like the stupid ladies of the Bread!!
Zepeda is a prominent Morenoite
"Go damian..
Come to brunette
Come and help transform the country

"Let's see, what the judges did, if I agree, they cannot make an assumption. Of what is going to happen, however, they will have to do the widowhood a posteriori."
"According to Article 35, section VIII, of the Mexican Constitution, judicial reform must be the subject, in any case, of judicial consultation by referring, it is not possible for a party to want to impose it."
"I recognize that Hamlet is very intelligent, unfortunately on the wrong team. My comment is based on the following: is it possible that he defends AMLO's lies? First-world health system, gasoline, insecurity, etc. The results are plain to see. Damiï¿1/2n, on the other hand, is an excellent politician, dical, congruent and very, very intelligent. Unfortunately the PAN is on the canvas. It will always be a pleasure to listen to you debate."
"There is the difference between someone who accepts the situation and another who does not Dami¿1/2n Zepeda tells him in the situation of poverty they did well the health thing is bad and the other answers first the poor as the president says when the question was how it was go is health,  They don't recognize anything"
"Mr. Damian Zepeda, stop saying that ""it can't be done"" that it is not possible"" if it can be and if it is happening, get to work with more agility and strategy, we do not see you angry or fierce in defense of the country, you see yourself very much in agreement with the regime."
Damiï¿1/2n knows that Hamlet is intelligent and that he will not be able to beat him in the debate.
It's not true in medical services I don't agree
Mr. Damian lowers his credibility
"Damian is a PAN member who is the opposition, who is not a joke and who can be objective."
According to the fans of the 4th deformation with the judicial reform we will be better than Denmark 
"Damiï¿1/2n ... please... What are you doing there, change to brunette"
"HAMLET, with that name and MORENACO, how ridiculous; he should change his name to AMBROSIO "
And not to mention the white-collar ones
"Let's see why they have to be pure lawyers who want to lead the country, that sounds very strange to me"
Another in the past years pure pure plï¿1/2 I say lawyer in law in the two chambers made laws in their own way
Damián needs to go to the Morena party.
DORA ARROLLO. HAMLET Sï¿1/2 IS AN EXCELLENT STALWART OF AMLO
"Here there is no support and there should be a trial of those judges, but well, with gala says that senator or former senator of the PAN.  DO THEY FORGET WHAT 
HE HAS MADE THE PRIAN THROUGH TIME AND TODAY HE CONTINUES TO EVADE,
DEFENDING MEXICO."
"Of course, the PAN governments abused power when they governed municipalities, states and the country. 
The Mexicans said: no more repression or abuses of power. And if they do, they should be judged by law."
"The reform is to remove corruption and nepotism from the judiciary. But the Ministers, Magistrates and Judges do not want to lose their privileges. They are not interested in the most important thing to dispense justice"
But it can be changed by removing the PRI bullies and corrupt judges.
"This debate is totally biased in favor of the opposition, the Morena one did not argue anything or emphasize anything."
"This time again Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda seems right to me, you always have to go to the right, that the others do not do it is not a justification for one to do it... This statement by the president is a huge lie, there are fewer and fewer resources in every way"
Zepeda is afraid of Hamlet
"Damoen zepeda is only language, because he did not throw himself in favor of the reform or because he did not propose his points of view, everyone at quarter to twelve, wanted to read and could not."
"Damián Zepeda for those who do not know him, was applauded of the EPN Reforms, a finger lifter"
Damiaï¿1/2n Zepeda is an honest person. The bad thing is that he is a PAN member.
Damian has a hard time accepting the truth of things.
"Stop LAUNCHING, MAKE A NEW CONSTITUTION, FORM A NEW CONSTITUENT. That of 1917 is already surpassed."
That deputy or senator of the PAN is the most prepared of the PAN because the others are nefarious but you have k approve what k is already for k won morena better change to morena mijo you are in the most nefarious party in Mexico for k they are not going to change your comrades
Damian studies the amparo law more
"Are you or are you not a democrat?
But democracy cannot be on the margins of Federalism or the Division of Public Power.
Someone has to counterbalance the dictatorship of parliamentary majorities when they attack fundamental principles of the Constitutional State.
There are also precedents of those parliamentary dictatorships that issue constitutional reforms and anti-democratic laws that violate human rights. 
It happened in Nazi Germany, in Fascist Italy and militarism in Chile and Argentina."
This is where Damiï¿1/2n is left as ignorant!
Zepeda does not put at the center it is not because it is unconstitutional but because it does not meet the requirements and criteria of analysis
"Let's see, commentators, I have already read their opinions and tell me at this moment that Zepeda voted in favor of the reform? For whatever reason, do not be confused or believe what Zepeda says, do not be malinchistas"
understand b the people have already decided what did not serve does not serve what they have told is Bukele clean and served
"It is disability ,,,,,,lost ,,,,,,"
"EVERY DAY DAMIAN HAS MORE THAN 4T THAN HE IMAGINES. DO NOT LIE, DO NOT STEAL AND DO NOT BETRAY THE PEOPLE"
I think that Damiï¿1/2n z did not deserve to be in that party of the PRIANMC PAN he is a good politician he should be in Morena next to the people
"That is the level that the opposition should have. It is evident that in the prian the level is very low, very poor and not to mention the top of the toga, the piï¿1/2a is a donkey, for example. Then? There is a lot to change."
Zepeda pure prominence
The PAN members continue to talk to themselves
Damiï¿1/2n you are a good dick
Damian Zepeda ask a brunette don't do it to the ox anymore
"Senator will give zepeda. I like your way of expressing the details, however, I will tell you that the opposition had the opportunity to read the reform and, if necessary, present an alternative analysis, but they rode on their donkey of moratorium, another they never took that basis into account when they were a majority and voted for the reforms of peï¿1/2anieto"
Hahaha they have AMLO as if he were Benito Juárez poor.
5:36 That's the joke. Do all this constitutionally so as not to break the law. The law is coupled with the new system. And the new system is not socialist. He is Chavista/Castroist. That is the danger.

"Contradictory Damiï¿1/2n Zepeda, that is called incongruity and finally it is incongruent because he has no arguments or failing that Damiï¿1/2n is cheating."
"The opposition is fraught, if things stay as they are, either way The winning alliance will have control of the SCJN, so it is only a matter of time."
Senator Fresa.
"Hahaha Zepeda very intelligent wanting to convince.... Haven't they doubled you? I remember you voting very mockingly for the Electricity Reform of the Peninsula!! What you know is that you have already realized that the people are already awake and politicized and you have nothing to hide, you are morally defeated...."
He is an opponent but he knows who he is messing with.
He is a legislator
It doesn't change it but it stops many kids who felt untouchable to see now if they are as Shingons as before

"Damian Zepeda, it's a pity you're from Sonora "
"Hamlet, don't tell lies"
"It seems that the Morenoites are still very lukewarm, they already have all the power – what else do they want? If all this results in serious incidents, the Morenoites who are stopping the reform must be judged with all severity."
"Damiï¿1/2n stop screwing around and join Morena, those losers have no qualms, everything is NO, they don't even think about profit, everything is BAD."
Damiï¿1/2n change party or form one you are the only congruent of the bread
"We gave Morena legitimacy through the votes -BUT, with constitutional legality"
"Zepeda I think is earning his points, he should be president of the PRIAN, mind you, I am a Morenoist,"
Surely Almaguer wants to be in the judiciary
"Lie in the insurance there are no medicines, and today to get an appointment for my dad in a specialty is impossible. Years ago you applied for it and at most it took you a week"
"Hamlet, an expert in evading topics, a nefarious guy"
Damian: So if it is possible for two powers to unite to overthrow another power? In this xaso I don't agree with you
Poor drug traffickers put themselves in the middle wool for a prosecutor wool for a judge don't suck
The reform was going on because enough was enough of the corrupt PRI members.
"Oh Juan Becerra, you are very tendentious!"

"Damina Zepeda for PAN President ahh and Sï¿1/2 I voted for AMLO and Claudia, but I have my conservative side as Pro-Life, Catholic and I shit on the Inclusive language as MORENA does, it is for idiots !!"
"This Zepeda coincides a lot with Morenista ideologies, I get the impression that he wants to (vote against) but he is happy with his party)"
The 4t deformation and the tropical messiah leaves a country like Denmark to .mexico 
"I am totally anti-PAN, all PAN members are disastrous to me, but I consider that Damian Zepeda is the only congruent who knows what he is saying and is not passionate like all the ignorant PAN members who get information on tik tok, X, Instagram, etc., and even worse the ""frustrated bourgeoisie"" of Atipycal TV"

"@BVS_Velasco3 @DeniseDresserG Mexico was a country of counterweights, the chambers were divided, so the proposals of a party or president were not automatically authorized, there are still autonomous bodies. Mexico chose something very different for the next six-year term and that is what worries"
"@tatclouthier The problem is not that, the problem is that they see that the court and autonomous bodies are over. If it is not now, it will be when they make those reforms."
"@Eliza_Rain Abolish the independence of the Judiciary, the autonomy of the INE, the autonomous bodies, disrupt, trample on and violate practically all the constitutional rights we have. So yes."
"@ClouthierManuel Morena's Plan C and the PUEBLA group will change the constitution and the autonomous bodies will disappear, there will be no counterweights and the supreme court will be an MP in a toga?

"@DaEcheverriaMX @INEMexico Curious that you defend autonomous organisms when you are attacking one and you don't believe in the result.
At the end of the day, democracy is democracy for you when it suits you."
"@tatclouthier They are realizing the chaos that is coming, with a State Election, changing the constitution and removing the autonomous bodies!!! Road to a DICTATORSHIP"
@PatyArmendariz I am terrified that the autonomous bodies will disappear and that the executive will appoint the ministers of justice by a show of hands and the perfect dictatorship will take shape
@Anaro74 Sad for the right and all right-wingers and all the intellectual fascists hahahaha because they lost all the media power of the autonomous organizations that were not impartial where the PRI was favored now they continue biting the bugs of courage hahahaha
60% of votes. 25 governorships. Congress with a qualified majority. A lot of political power. In what will you use it? Reform the court and the autonomous bodies and concentrate more power in the presidency? To stop the advance of the army? Introduce progressive taxes?
"@LOVREGA There are no autonomous bodies, you really study so that you are well informed, the INE was created by the PRI in the mandate of Salinas de Gortari, I think you were one of the beneficiaries of the privileges of the supreme court and you are affected"
"@sangreDeTal @AlmaMaderoIV Amlo could not do so because he did not have the qualified majority to change the constitution nor did he have power over the supreme court! Zedillo removed ministers but he never wanted to put a supreme court in charge of the courts, nor did he want to destroy the autonomous bodies!"
"@JorgeArmandoR_ Denise Dresser has a snout full of reason, there will be no opposition, everything will be approved even if it is bad, the first victims will be the INAI and it will be followed by the rest of the autonomous organizations that AMLO brings them wanting."
"@Gerardo_Tavara @ONPE_oficial @ReniecPeru We are already in a dictatorship like that of Cuba and Venezuela politicizing autonomous organizations, so they will be kidnapped like the TC and the Ombudsman's Office. How is it possible that the congressional mafia majority of 100 people has bent more than 30 million Peruvians. Wake up."
"@hdemauleon As you hurt me, Mexico, today is a sad day for me, the danger that our legally constituted institutions are in imminent danger, the Court and the Autonomous Organizations can disappear at the discretion of the new Government!!
So much that it cost us to build, what a shame!"
"@tatclouthier Letter to stop the fall of the stock market in the face of the concern of Congress with a qualified majority. Good to give certainty.
Absolute power makes the markets nervous, even more so when it has been announced to modify the autonomous and control bodies.
Hopefully they will do the same for the court."
"@IcE_MaNmX @mario_dico50 @R_Ramirez_O @Pemex @Hacienda_Mexico Of course, it does not depend on the Sec of Finance but AMLO announced that in September reforms will come, that is what we Mexicans want to know, if the INE, the judiciary, the autonomous agencies are going to modify or disappear, because those bills have already been presented,  with drastic changes"
"@Melissa_Bely He says that neoliberalism was a disaster, someone would like to inform him that in that period the foundations were laid for autonomous organizations that, such as the INE, the INAI, among others, allowed him to come to power through the vote of those who trusted him."
@tigredelacuyal @elgatopolitico_ The ideal would be to agree again with the judiciary and the autonomous bodies that they themselves make the necessary adjustments so that they really work as they should and offer the possibility of making constitutional changes agreed upon between them.
"@laishawilkins Universities and autonomous bodies can send initiatives that, if approved in referrals, should become law"
"@genarolozano @elimparcialcom Move forward with your project, what will that project be? Well, the one who had already sung to us, goodbye INE, goodbye the constitution as we know it, goodbye the autonomous organisms. What a great tragedy we are experiencing, what impotence"
"@fanzypinky @PonchoGutz He refers to his animal generation, the autonomous organisms were the ones that allowed plurality and political alternation, (in 4 elections with INE there were 3 parties in power), now there are people going to return to the system that took 70 years to eradicate."
"@lopezobrador_ good day Mr. President, congratulations on the triumph of Dr. Claudia Sheinbaum. 
A question regarding the reforms, the elimination of autonomous bodies that will happen to the staff? Thank you for your attention."
"@lion_katt @RicardoAlemanMx @Xochitl2024 @STaboadaMx Well, I think that with the changes that they are going to make to the constitution and the disappearance of the autonomous organisms, I don't think that our vote in the future will have any value and without counterweights they will put the laws in order to always win, and not as anger but because of the conditions."
"@DiarioProgre @PumaChairo Because you would want the elimination of autonomous bodies that put a stop to state power?
Is not wanting a super-powerful state fascism?"
@Marina_abog I am in one of the autonomous organisms? I'm already redoing my CV
"@bereaguilarv Claudia said that she will continue with Q4, I don't think she has her own path. 
It seems to me that she is only the hinge, to unite the initial strategy of Lopez towards a Socialist Dictatorship of Andy Lopez Beltrï¿1/2n in perpetuity.
Maybe that's why they're going to destroy autonomous organisms."
"@EVerastegui @INEMexico And in any case, if the complicity of the INE in the commission of an electoral crime were to be revealed, I still trust the autonomous bodies and the judicial authority. The electoral tribunal of the judiciary shall decide what is appropriate in the last instance."
"@NaZLeLu @mon_giovi @ZenTraderMx You don't understand that you don't understand, we will return to the governments before 1970. The autonomous bodies are over, the SCJN will be taken over so that any law, although it violates the constitution, cannot be annulled. Risk of changing the entire constitution. At the moment they have a majority."
"@beltrandelrio The autonomous organizations did not put the brakes on the PRI and PAN administrations, they did not stop Macron's reforms in France, in Chile, in Brazil, in Obama's United States... What are you talking about?"
"@SergioSarmiento They have all the power to do so, there are no checks and balances in the chambers and the Judiciary was one of the few autonomous bodies that remained. To enjoy what you voted ?"
"@bereaguilarv Fatal this, they should not destroy autonomous organisms, they are part of democracy, we must not allow that"
"@PatyArmendariz Form 3475 to say
Congress will be used to eliminate autonomous, transparency and accountability bodies

The balance of powers no longer exists, the legislature only serves as a lackey of the executive.
They call them to the palace and they line up as if they were going to tortillas"
"@ranarzate I think it is an exaggeration of the measures that were taken this six-year term, from the pressure on autonomous bodies or interference in the judiciary.

There are reasons to believe that Claudia will continue with that same line but I also doubt that they will go to those extremes haha"
"@JackSpartanXX Is that what I think seeing the economic turbulence from the first day ï¿1/2 ï¿1/2 Will you let the kks do its ""reforms"" ? Will you be willing to accept a devaluation from the first day of your government? Destroy the autonomous organisms that give certainty to the USMCA? Will you want to manage chaos?"
"@beltrandelrio How sad, when they begin with their modifications to the laws that regulate the autonomous bodies, it will be the beginning of the change they chose in these elections!"
"@karchymiranda At least they did not dynamite the judiciary, INE, INAI and other autonomous bodies"
"Perhaps for the majority, checks and balances, transparency, accountability, autonomous bodies, etc., are not important, as long as they are sold as necessary sacrifices to vindicate the class struggle. And that is enough. And the forms don't matter. And neither do the pacts."
"@Politica_Basica hahahaha? 
MORENA wins because there are no longer autonomous bodies and reforms in the INE and the SCJN 
It's as simple as that"
"Autonomous bodies such as the INAI to have it in the SFP that is to say goodbye transparency since now the government is the one that is going to decide if it gives you access to certain information of government contracts - no, goodbye IFT which means that the government can give you ?10/15"
"There is really not going to be anyone to defend the autonomous bodies or the Judiciary. The opposition has no legislative power and if it marches, there is no leftist who joins them (even if it is in their interests) because what dare to rub shoulders with someone from the PRIAN."
"@Dantorres2022 @julioastillero Unfortunately, autonomous organisms in this country are anything but autonomous."
"For the whole ball of comments and PRI intellectuals who talk about the ""risk of September.""

That is, the fear that AMLO will reform the Judiciary, the INE and the autonomous bodies before leaving.

Know that the 60% who voted for Morena is what we WANT and DEMAND."
@Bere_niceray Peï¿1/2a's reforms did not seek the dismantling of autonomous bodies
@LauraUlloa_CUN @lopezobrador_ the so-called autonomous organisms
"@Claudiashein @R_Ramirez_O It would be good to confirm once and for all, Madam President-Elect, that you are not going to demolish the Judiciary or the autonomous bodies"
"@JoeGusRNew @DJMatus I think we should stop thinking about autonomous organisms, we have been told for a long time that they are going to disappear."
"@eduardomenoni with the majority in the Senate and Congress, he has an open letter to do what he wants, he wants judges to be elected by the people, just as he wants to disappear the INE that earned him his victory, to disappear autonomous bodies."
"@carlosmeleno @rivapa Well, let Taddei go to jail, along with all those responsible, and Peje stop putting his hands on autonomous organisms. They must reform that they elect between the SCJN and the chambers the representatives of the INE. By profile and knowledge."
"@FloresBenavid He gets hives from the parties but he is glad that a woman wins who is going to destroy the SCJN as it is, in addition to the autonomous bodies. Ok, I got it.

""What if that were the problem?"" The point is that it is called non-partisan and it is not."
"Out with more faces? @XochitlGalvez, she does not respect our decision and much less respects the institutions, contesting the election is a sign of her false concern for the autonomous bodies, that's how she and the PRIAN, some unscrupulous hypocrites only want to steal, that's all they want to do"
@alejandraaaval2 Now I fear for the autonomous bodies and the judiciary?
"@R_Ramirez_O 1.- They have gone into debt even though you and Lï¿1/2 deny it.
2.- Subsidies to the declining PEMEX will continue
3.- Wanting to submit to the SCJN and put an end to mandatory autonomous/regulatory bodies to maintain the USMCA does not calm investors."
"@PatyArmendariz And without forgetting the INAI and other ""autonomous"" organizations.

They are just dark-handed management offices!"
"@Valk6 @DonDevaluacion Ajï¿1/2 and they are inefficient ""autonomous"" organizations and are an expense that should not exist, tell me a relevant case that COFECE has resolved? The INAI is more relevant because of what its directors have spent, additionally, you did not answer me who dissolved the supreme court in the nineties."

"THAT is FRAUD 

To take away representation from @SEGOB_mx one or the other Party

"@VLIS_CuentaX @KakarotLegend24 @MundoEConflicto The PRI was so much dictatorship that it was the party that reinforced the judiciary in 1994, created autonomous bodies, created an autonomous body for elections, improved working and educational conditions, signed the FTA with the United States, etc."
"@VLIS_CuentaX @KakarotLegend24 @MundoEConflicto Just a few states.
And in fact, this Morena government is the six-year term with the most homicides, crimes, and also with more attempts at dictatorship, they tried to take away the Autonomous Institute of Elections, they want to remove the autonomous bodies and they want to disappear the Justice."
"@PTelloVillagran One of the main economic risks of the judicial reform and the forthcoming reform, relating to the disappearance of autonomous bodies, is the possibility of losing investment opportunities that generate companies, employment and taxes."
"@Feri_saud @DanielBarredaP Now the really interesting thing is to know if he is going to vote in favor of Morena's proposal to disappear autonomous organizations.

Could you give us an advance or do you have to negotiate again?"
"@mexazulgranaa @PonchoGutz @LauraMex To begin with, impartiality will be lost, the old PRI (which is already in Morena) has already shown you why it is not right for a single party to have power over everything. If you finished primary school they taught you the function of the 3 powers and their importance as autonomous organisms"
"Autonomous Organisms as a mode, an Army minimized to the role of simple police, procuring institutions and a weak Executive.

That is just what the national oligarchs and transnational corporations want to plunder resources at will!"
"@CiroGomezL @DavidPramo2 Without legal certainty there would be no investment, and it would begin to be felt earlier by the reforms announced to the Judiciary and the disappearance of autonomous bodies."
"@OmarBustani @miguelmanceras1 @Rommel_Pacheco @CONADE The secretaries are NOT autonomous bodies, but SUBORDINATE to the presidential command.
If you are the boss and you can't choose your right hands, you can NEVER guarantee your own work. Why is it so difficult to understand?"
"@AlvarezMaynez Cheer up, there are only 4 state legislatures left and we WILL START National Guard and autonomous organizations...

For work we do not stop AND FOR TEARING, WHINING or whatever you have to say.

This started six years ago and WE DON'T WANT IT TO STOP."
