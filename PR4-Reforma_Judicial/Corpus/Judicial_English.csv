"Currently, to reach a position as a judge or magistrate it is necessary to have 15 or 20 years of preparation in the country's judicial circuits, in addition to complying with various filters and parameters before practicing.

"Corruption and impunity are also present in the prosecutors' offices, the prosecutors' offices need to be reformed"
The overwhelming majority of Mexicans support and celebrate the approval of the reform. Long live the Mexican people!
"They are practically raising the top of those who do nothing for the people, they only use them, what is the problem or what is wrong with that?"

Congratulations!!!!

Applause.
Very good so it must be I agree
Time will answer this.
IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE CORRUPT JUDGES AND ALL THEIR BOSSES
They said it in the opposite way: the Disciplinary Tribunal is the one that will hear the complaints and the procedures of public servants
We too must vote in trials electronically and sentence criminals
At least we will be able to claim and denounce corrupt officials.
"These guys were served with the big spoon, finally they ran out of their little gold "
Treatment in state local and regional prosecutors' offices
Hopefully they will not be the same and that they are not on the side of organized crime
"Excellent!.
Long live our beloved leader!."
The model that is presented is very good and over time it will be better strengthened

"It is a perfect reform, which will guarantee prompt and expeditious justice for all. It will take time like any process. Very calm my people."
"God provides for everything to go well, we trust in everything that makes cotton head"
The reform requires a thorough review of all members of the court
"Local prosecutors who are corrupt may be brought to trial in federal courts. So yes, local results will also be affected positively or negatively."

It should be every 6 years
"Excellent changes, I don't see how they say that we are on the way to being like Venezuela "
Very well
And the prosecutors' offices for when?
Very good renovation
"I think the model of protocols and filters to elect the minister is excellent, Judicial Reform "
"It strikes me that the reform changes ""those who have exercised legal work"" to ""elected by the people"". In other words, a lawyer who has dedicated himself to running a company instead of practicing as a lawyer, who is now a millionaire, who is charismatic and can become a potential politician has a better chance of becoming a judge"
Bravissimo PODER JUDICIAL POPULAR the opposition and Piña are ? RELEV? ANTES
"Unfortunately, in a city where the votes are not so analyzed by people with low education, it is difficult to reach a healthy and convenient democracy, since the parties are in charge of giving ""support"" in exchange for votes and thus achieve their candidates ""triumphant by majority"", a majority that does not get involved in researching and knowing what they are voting for."

What does the reform consist of? Easy. It's like a magic trick with cards. You choose a card from the cards that are put in front of you and that's it. Who chooses the cards that are put in front of you? That doesn't matter (although it's not hard to guess that the cards are from the magician).

"They are on the right track, but most of the corruption is at the local level, what is below is also well rotten, it is known that you start from the top, but there must also be changes to the lowest that can be made, from the federal to the local level."
It should be reduced to 5 should not be greater than the president's

If you agree, share, copy and paste on your social networks...."
"Minister Piña so far this year 2024 has spent 20 million 347 thousand pesos from the budget on personal expenses, this as they call it, has released 4 highly dangerous mafiosi..... he has García Luna's relatives working by his side...."
"I think that the people are wrong, what they want to know is that if the judge who is going to lead the judiciary is really honest, easy and simple, no more corruption and the people know it well"
"This is easy, that they are paid as a basic education teacher earns if they are going to be crying."
"How cool it is to see them cry, how good that people voted to get rid of all these scourges once and for all"
"And why don't they also do that purge in the legislative and executive branches, which corruption and nepotism is synonymous with"
"The SCJN is so necessary that if it disappears, it affects no one. A more austere judicial reform must be made, we have already seen that luxuries do not guarantee justice or prevent corruption."
I admire the right-wingers who do not understand that they are corrupt.
"Not only the judiciary, but in all government agencies, such as those of the IMSS, the ISSSTE, mayors' offices, etc"
"THIS TYPE OF INTERVIEW IS VERY IMPORTANT, SINCE I CONSIDER THAT A MAJORITY OF CITIZENS DO NOT KNOW IN DETAIL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE JUDICIARY AND THESE INTERVIEWS CLARIFY SO MANY DOUBTS. IN ADDITION TO SEEING HOW COMPLICATED IT IS TO CARRY OUT THIS REFORM. THAT IS WHY HE FULLY SUPPORTED THE JUDICIARY."
"And what is the fear that they will be thrown away? If the Judicial Branch were effective, there would not be this type of problem. The Magistrate says that she has to decide for one of the parties in a trial, however, having the file, the evidence and legal tricks do not apply the rules or adequately base or motivate the resolutions and grant amparos and acquittals and convictions in an unlawful sense, but the investiture and the procedural locks of the laws themselves shield them from being able to appeal those resolutions.  that is why the people and society are tired of the lack of adequate, prompt, expeditious and imprecise justice."
"In Greece there was never democracy. Look at the history and its culture. In addition, the grammar of that time."
Please do not allow yourselves to be prayed for our country
"Voting is not synonymous with democracy but a tool of it, if a vote helps to concentrate power it is undemocratic."
Not letting the judicial reform pass save Mexico
"The pros are for the judges, who will no longer be able to profit, and abusing the position the rest is good, not impunity, not abuse better justice."
Everything that he defends in favor of reform is perfectible. But they are imposing something that not even they guarantee because they don't even know it
They are all corrupt and will continue to be corrupt

"Thank God avenge the righteous men and women who seek equity. and equality for peoples.   Vote. For Plan ,,,C,,,"
"That according to maestro Javier Martín, is not professional at all, you can see that he is burned. "

"Of course, there is pure nepotism in government positions"
It is an undoubted improvement for the benefit of the people. The simple fact that judges and notaries earn fairly and not the extra-spherical amounts they earn today.
"If corruption is going to end with the vote of the people, let's dedicate ourselves to voting for everything"
"The pros are of the vast majority and the cons of a minority, so the great majority must be respected."
"Congratulations to the Mexican people, Brazil also needs a judicial reform, we have one of the most expensive judiciary in the world and even so, a lot of corruption, there is no law to punish the rich"
"IF THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY, WHY IS IT BEING CONVENED? WELL, BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE IN THAT POSITION DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING MORE THAN CHARGE AT THEIR CONVENIENCE, AND WHAT THEY EARN, IN THE END THE PEOPLE PAY THEM. IF THEY DON'T WORK, GET OUT; THAT THE LINE IS LONG."
"PATRIOTS ARE REQUIRED, DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE WHO OFFEND YOU AS TRAITORS.
THAT SENATORS FROM MC, PRI AND PAN BE INVITED TO VOTE TOGETHER WITH MORENA AND ALLIES FOR THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY, THEY WILL BE ADMIRED FOR THEIR COURAGE AND WE WILL RECOGNIZE THEM AS PATRIOTS"
"He may be very doctorate, but his analysis is right."
And he talks about nepotism and how many relatives of Monreal ai in sacatecas and ai many more nomas than those of eos are justifiable
you should not run around.
Like if the judges were going to give you a receipt for how much you gave them as a bribe and so you have proof of corruption hahah or tra is that the one who has money always earns a guicio the judges are to the highest bidder
"That they lower his salary in the s c j n

"Hahahaha debate ?? I don't see any ordinary guests, people from the people and affected by this judiciary and look that there are millions, here I see those who always say black if the government says white. Analysts??? My leggings"

It is so clear that only those who have privileges could not agree with this reform.

"Viva Mexico!, I don't want a scholarship, I want an opportunity."
Because they don't clean up the prosecutors' offices...
"These ministers and judges do not want to work and are afraid of being judged.

"Well, it's okay, what happens is that in part there was a commodity of the PJ and there was a lot of corruption in it"
"Naaaaa, what is urgent is a legislative reform, because the judicial power of the federation only applies what the constitution indicates and guess who elaborates/repeals or modifies the laws? It is done by the Legislative Branch (which is the Congress of the Union made up of senators and deputies, in the requirements to be a senator or deputy they do not require an educational level; that is why we are as we are, in the Chamber they fight, discuss, do not respect each other.

I don't know about you, but I would prefer that a professional, example, a doctor, perform surgery on me than someone who has no knowledge or experience."
"I think it's perfect,
1 In the PJ there was only NEPOTISM, which did not guarantee the quality of its participants.
2 Justice was only dispensed for the particular interests of those who could bribe or have power over the judges
3 The results of the PJ in the last 20 years have made its INEPTITUDE more than clear, so reform is necessary, 
4 This promotes citizen participation in judicial processes, so that we will be better aware and aware of the movements, to eventually make better decisions.

everything is, pure Nepobaby is dissatisfied because they are the ones who will lose their privileges,"
"Taking advantage of the reform and the popular vote, we will also be able to vote and elect doctors to attend to the lagging health sector, taking advantage of the fact that they are doctors of the people, even if they do not have experience, there is no quarrel, it is not needed"
Today it was worth mothers.

In Venezuela Maduro did the same with a coup d'état, he reduced the number of magistrates in the Supreme Court, which is the Court there"
Waters with the last point. Therein lies the hidden trick. So that the Judiciary does not reverse laws approved by the congress a congress completely dominated by 1 single party. That's the worrying thing.
And he left the viper screeching. The judiciary is still on vacation in an alleged strike where the ? It doesn't advance.. What a bomb is going to explode 
Hahahahaha and why did they attack each other? Why can't he do his job by bribing? Ministers and judges? Hahahaha because they won't have to. Paying lawyers for years because it will be faster?  Hahaha for the people it is a good option thousands of innocents in there and thousands of hdspt out here!! Enough!!! And even if they don't like it and even if they do a thousand marches!! They know that this is what marginalized people need
There is no freedom without plurality
"Look how convenient they do not want the Judiciary to overturn their unconstitutional laws,"
"What they say sounds really wonderful, it remains to be seen that it is true."
REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY IS URGENT!
Total Anarchy Again My Montesquieu
The Equal Employment Law was missing where a public servant can apply to work in the Judiciary and at the same time atone as a federal agent and take to jail corrupt public prosecutors and judges and colleagues who break the law
"I think it's okay, I approve of it as a Mexican "
"The good thing about this is that it is totally cleansed of corrupt people 
And trial of the former presidents and traitors to the homeland and let them start with Norma piña.!!"
To the extent that the magistrates and the CJF I work for the state judiciary and it does not affect me at all for those who believe that everything is going to change at the local level
SHOUTING FOR JUDICIAL REFORM
"Very well, who thinks about what is spent on propaganda? It would be much less than what the 11 judges receive for nothing, they are corrupt and so are their relatives"
"Now the legislative and executive powers will have no counterweight or anyone to stop them, now the monster has just been unleashed to make his free judgment, and if any judge wants to oppose impeachment of him, it is not because it is enough"
"Well, the chili is good"
Grupo Electra is preparing your money so that you pay what you owe in taxes
To communism
Changes are always good!!
Is the popular election of Thursdays and magistrates only at the federal level or will it affect the judicial powers of the states?
Why does he have an eye like this? Already belongs to the black eye club??
No wonder those of the judicial branch of the federation are going to fall
"That is to say, the aspirant to the judiciary with which he complies only with being a lawyer, etc., etc. If you work in a furniture store recovering collection with that, it doesn't matter that you don't have experience and a legal career 
No pss yes! Nice reform that this executive proposed and approved, and obviously c approved because the majority bench is brown"
Enjoy what you VOTED .  !!!!
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REFORM DOES NOT PASS?
Look: Luisa María knows other things that besides modeling for brunette commercials 
"My respects to Andrés Manuel! Yes, if he is a genius!"
Yes in favor
With everything for those corrupt PJ.
"All Mexicans who are conscientious support the reform of the judiciary, that is why we voted for more than thirty-six million Mexicans to remove these corrupt people from the judiciary"
The initiative is to overcome their witticisms of more madness
It will be his last joke before he leaves 
Yes to the judicial resignature.
We are all judicial power 
"To resolve, Xochitl president"
another nail in the coffin of the excellent PRIAN!! 
Corrupt ministers out!!
The people should not allow the plurinominals and much less the fuero.
If we are fed up with so much abuse and nothing of true justice.
"IT CONSISTS OF PUTTING THE JUDICIARY IN ORDER, STOPPING PAYING THEM FROM THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE, FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD TO THE REMODELING OF THEIR HOUSES, ETC, ETC, ETC, MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAR BECAUSE WE ARE MUCH MORE INFORMED THAN BEFORE AND WE NO LONGER FALL INTO FAKE NEWS."
"They should remove all those who are now ministers, they are bad apples. Renew."
It is necessary to clean up and punish corrupt judges
"Court ministers of the highest doctrinal legal knowledge and experience, honest honorable"
"Well, it's the truth, I agree. Every now and then they take out criminals for moches daily."
"I still remember when the PRI and PAN approved reforms to receive more Christmas bonus and advance more salary, etc etc"
We are fed up with so much abuse!!
MAINLY REMOVE THE CORRUPT IN THE MAGISTRATE.
"We are going for plan C, that is why we voted for the majority"
"WE MUST LEARN TO SEPARATE JUSTICE FROM POLITICS let the judges do justice. Justice is applied, not reformed; laws are reformed.
The separation of powers, enshrined in the Constitution for more than 150 years, aims to prevent the abuse of power and guarantee judicial independence.
I listened in an interview to a former minister of the Court, where he strangely stated that justice must be reformed and, with all respect, it is not reformed, it is applied.
This intended reform, which is to be carried out, aims, among other things, to reduce the number of ministers; reduce the period of their assignment from 15 to 12 years; eliminate the two Chambers so that they only sit in Plenary, that is, again, concentrate the decision under the same people in all matters, regardless of the subject; election by popular vote of ministers, magistrates and judges, that is, ignoring the judicial career and the achievements or successes of the members of the Judiciary and letting them be elected under the principle of whoever makes the best political propaganda; but the most serious is the prohibition of granting suspensions against general norms, constitutional controversies and actions of unconstitutionality, that is, that no one can defend himself, not even provisionally, in the event that there are reforms that violate Human Rights
What is intended is authoritarianism and the concentration of power in a single person or party; we must not forget what history teaches us in relation to governments and States where there is no division of powers, where they only deceive by making the governed believe that sovereignty resides in the people, where the Constitution or fundamental laws are modified and transformed to achieve the benefit of a few.
This so-called reform under the slogan Let's continue making history, should remind us of what happened or is happening in other countries, where there is no real and effective division of powers, as was the case in Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union under Stalin's regime, China, where from 1949 to 1976 power was centralized in the Communist Party; as in Iraq with Saddam Hussein, as well as the dictatorship of North Korea and, also, the dictatorship and tyranny that Venezuela is experiencing."
Why are judges and magistrates not elected by votes of the people?
"If I agree, remove all the magistrates"
Excellent 
"Only family and friends work there, they make you take an exam to fill positions and even if you pass the exam they leave you waiting and never call you because they already have it given to family and friends, hopefully they will change because it is a big corruption, it seems that the judges and magistrates are the owners"
"Impressive, as they don't say everything, it's much more than what it reported!, they don't talk about pros or cons"
He also said that the Provincial Councils of the plurinominal would be extinguished
And what does Telerisa think of all this?
"Not carnal, the people cannot decide who the judges will be because about 60% of Mexico is not qualified to cast their vote in this field. The only thing you will do is divide the unity that judges have now, and now open a political market for the Judiciary even more corruptible due to the lack of privacy in information. There are things in which the people should not interfere."
"AS ARTURO SALDIVAR SAID TODAY, More than 35 million Mexicans, almost 36 million votes voted for PLAN C and for Mexicans to elect our judges at the polls, through popular vote, justice is not a privilege, justice is a right, let's return justice to those who belong to it,  to the people of Mexico, or to finally make the maxim of all rights for all people a reality, thank you very much."
"Are the years still going by and the government is still seeing our faces? finally the PRI comes out and we bring him back to the presidency, a candidate brings out good dances and tick tock songs and we vote him as governor, Morena with his ball of ampones snatches a power that was not seen since the PRI regime and people believe that he is the hope of Mexico... MEXICO'S WORST EVIL IS IGNORANCE "
"Thank you, thank you very much...! Corrupt judges will no longer have a place in the implementation of justice in Mexico. "
"So they have approved a variety of reforms that have affected each of the unions, it happened with the educational reform, energy reform, reforms come and go and we have all been run over by those multiple reforms, now these subjects want to be saved, no... So many of us protested the reforms and no one took them away, they continued because they will have to overthrow this ... It's a bit unfair that life is and will be."
"Extortion should be prosecuted ex officio, since it is one of the crimes with the highest impact on citizens."
.... Plan c... That is what the people voted for...
"AS ARTURO SALDIVAR SAID TODAY, They are public and known to all of us, How was all this done with the mask of supposed judicial independence, the judiciary said we are independent and we can do what we want and we do not have to explain ourselves to anyone, but they forgot that the people are not stupid and on June 2 the people sent a strong message that a profound judicial reform is required and that we require a different justice, almost 36 million votes told the ministers, no more injustice, Enough is enough, we want a sensitive judiciary, close to the people, with humanism and fundamentally a more democratic judiciary."
We are on the right track if we are on the right track for reform
"If it is about removing the corrupt why don't we start with the heads of Morena, the governors of Morena etc... and then we analyzed a proposal that does no harm to Mexico at all"
"Remember something. Salinas is afraid that this will be approved, they will make him pay every penny, his friends will no longer be there to give him protection. Doriga is afraid that the extortion case of that old man, who for reasons of life lost his file, will be reopened"
"WE ALL VOTED FOR PLAN C TO TAKE AWAY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE SCJN.  AND THAT THE INFLUENCE ON JUDICIAL ISSUES, CORRUPTION, INJUSTICE AND IMPUNITY ENDS, LONG LIVE THE JUDICIAL REFORM ???"
"""THE STAIRS ARE SWEPT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM""

LONG LIVE OUR MEXICAN REPUBLIC 
"
"Because the good people do not understand politics, laws, much less they are immersed in their daily needs to see how to get their family ahead, because everything is already very expensive, they no longer know what to do to achieve what they earn, everything goes up and electricity, gas, water, etc. That was what the people voted for, they repeated their social programs"
"The Reform should serve to ensure that criminals in suits go to jail and to lower the level of crimes resulting from corruption, otherwise not even the scandal is worth it."
"Excellent, those parasites 
They are very abusive
We are fed up with so much injustice"
That these reforms be made to the judiciary for the good of all. Plan C will bring good news. Every Mexican will be happy and shout with excitement when they meet them.
"That is why we voted that we will reform the judiciary that it be cleaned up, we are tired of this judicial power removing criminals, pure corruption on their part"
"Wow, if the ministers are put by the presidents, that's just the data so that they go to whom the supreme judges serve"
"A complete mistake!, people do not know about the subject, not all citizens are lawyers, how the hell will they know who is the best representative?, although it is known that they vote for the worst option, just because the candidate likes them or is handsome, a rather silly decision, such an important function should not be left lightly and given to people who do not know the subject?"
"Yes, let it be approved!"
At this time the judges and magistrates represent the MARÍA CORINA OF MEXICO 
"They earn so much money, we already know whose assets and privileges are. Those who reach those positions, it is as if they won the lottery."
And not only the ministers but magistrates of the collegiate and district judges
I just remind you that last year a judge forgave the abuse of an 8-year-old girl and let the perpetrator go free
Let it be very clear.. All the litigants who have to deal daily with their majesties the judges know that this reform has been urgent for more than 30 years...
"Already explained with apples to understand what this reform is, it seems excellent to me that it is a reality and not a utopia. Long live the 4th, long live Andrés Manuel, and long live Mexico"
"Without a doubt, things MUST change."
Excellent renovation
"There is no doubt that a change is needed! in the United States they vote for judges, in this way they try to do their job well to be able to be reelected, God bless Mexico, God bless their rulers, give them a right heart to govern!"
Hopefully it will be approved 
Since they run those people and put a new one that does comply
186000 pesos salary is still a robbery of the country in the private initiative when they would earn 50000 pesos a month
They will take away their privileges 
Very well k clean up that judicial power
CRY OUT FOR JUDICIAL REFORM
"FOR YOU TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AMLITO YOU MUST DO THE SAME WITH L@S MAYORS, THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER REELECTED IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THAT THE PEOPLE VOTE PUBLICLY FOR THE ONE OF THEIR PREFERENCE AND THAT AOLO LASTS IN OFFICE FOR 3 YEARS AND THE VERGS"
WE ARE GOING FOR JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL REFORM PLAN C
"Various reports and studies, such as those of Transparency International and the Corruption Perceptions Index, place Mexico among the countries with the greatest problems in this area, there is a very big problem in our country of impunity, nepotism and corruption. But you must also be consistent and not allow favoritism as in the case of Yasmin Esquivel"
"We the people already know it, and the majority we gave them is for that, to remove power. Judicial and reform it, that is the order and that is how it has to be"
I'm super right-wing and for the first time I think I don't see it so bad.
"Why give them so many years?
Why not give them a shorter period and conditional on working according to the law, and the first time they fail to dismiss them"
"simple but not bad, what do students complain about? that tomorrow they won't give them a job by leverage?"
"The truth is that I think it is a good reform, only that on Twitter they crucify it a lot."
"What a barbarity!! Very soon everyone will regret it because this is not good at all, poor Mexicans"
"Aaaaah that's why they're farting so much, because they're going to lower their huge salary"
They don't want to let go of the bone
"They have had a lot of coughing in Mexico.
I have lived for 20 years in Florida USA and the voters have always chosen the Judges."
"Until today ""justice"" is always in favor of those who have the most money, now whoever is guilty whether they have money or not, will have to pay with jail for corruption or crimes that merit it, the next step is to remove the immunity of all politicians and be condemned as what they are CRIMINALS."
"Well, here we see that the minimum wage for the population of our country Mexico is too notorious."
All with a judicial career and for six years the same as the other powers
But why people are complaining so much I don't understand anything
They have already stolen. A lot without work
"AS ARTURO SALDIVAR SAID TODAY, TRUE SOCIAL JUSTICE REQUIRES THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE IN THEIR APPARATUS OF JUSTICE, WITHOUT SOCIAL LEGITIMATION, INDEPENDENCE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MASK TO JUDGE AGAINST THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE, THE SOCIAL LEGITIMACY IN THE JUSTICE OF MEXICO HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR A LONG TIME.  But perhaps it has never been in a worse situation than now, if we ask the people who did it in the dialogues for transformation, six intense months, more than 400 forums, people tell you that we have an elitist justice, a justice that privileges those who have, over those who do not, that mistreats women,  that punishes poverty and not crime and that has no social legitimacy."
Another disappointment
An end to the autonomy of all government institutions
If the judicial reform 100=*%
My comment is number 300!! Congratulate me 
"That magistrates, ministers and judges also be prosecuted for corruption, theft, aligning with crime, etc. No one above justice, do not steal, do not kidnap, do not be complicit in theft, crime, etc."
"Yes, that's how it should be that the people decide. And if it is necessary that there is a consultation, citizen consultation. And that's democracy not as they have it, badly done"
"Those who ask to be elected would be the members of the council of the judiciary because they are those who review the function of ministers, magistrates and district judges, but ministers should not be appointed by popular election"
"Eliminate the
Plurinominal"
"1.-One thing must be clear: the boss is the people who pay the salaries of the Judiciary through the taxes that each citizen deposits, as a matter of law, if the judicial reform does not satisfy the employer to whom he pays, there will always be problems through the voice of the people
2.-The one who pays the salaries of the judiciary, which is the people, obviously does not agree with resolutions where the great oligarchs who do not want to pay taxes and who stop the resources of the people of Mexico are kept and protected, these great oligarchs who are protected by the judiciary, that is not serving the one who pays the salary of the judiciary, it is attacking the boss
3.-A judiciary that is not thinking of contributing to legal certainty for those who pay their salary is totally wrong, a judiciary always has to seek justice among the governed, but it must not forget that it is the one who pays for the daily life of the three powers, the people are the boss, the people pay the salaries of the three powers and the three levels of government"
"In other words, in Mexico does a public servant of the judiciary earn 116 thousand dollars?"
"Rather because we are fed up with reforms, paying very high salaries, corruption, classism, not representing the people, their privileges, their tricks, letting criminals go free, it is clear to you "
"It doesn't explain much about this note, does it? And it is because although they want to look for how to misinform, many people no longer succeed, only those who out of resentment of being affected their interests criticize everything and others who out of solidarity with them too, it is no longer like before."
"I suggest that the Chapitos and the Trivagos be judges, and that Minister Zaldivar return "
HASI SE SE HACESE QUE SE HACER QUE EL PUEBLO AGREED.
Out with the corrupt judges
"Let's not forget that as long as the opponents are allowed to continue to be part of the new government, the problems; they will continue, and from bad to worse. ! Let's beware of evil in the human being! ! So says God in the Bible!"
"0:12 Is Yeidckol Polevnsky?..... no ma, if life has treated her badly."
"God, don't let me fall on the road, don't let my heart and mind poison them, don't let me fall into temptation and deliver me from my enemies, amen "
" yes, demolish that system garbage! And let's see what comes out of the new construction."
That's good but once and for all to the prosecutors
"Those who oppose it are in total agreement because they do not want to let go of their bones,"
"This power needs a fundamental transformation, if you really want to do things well, but as any change creates uncertainty as to whether apparent justice ends or dead justice appears, if you really seek something good for Mexico, it remains to be seen and the risks that should be the minimum because in the way it is done it seems that there are risks that are not glimpsed then as thinking people for the good of Mexico. Mexico"
Perfect!!!!!
Get rid of the corrupt and put the corrupt from Morena. The end!
It wasn't much of an explanation... They are afraid to report
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT HAPPENS IF THE REFORM DOES NOT PASS?
"Excellent! And now the PRI will no longer be able to put its foot down HAHA because there is already a majority of brunettes, now they are sweating cold"
Now comes the cool part
"The fact that it is by popular vote is a very big problem, the judiciary is going to be politicized, I know that it is already somewhat politicized, but now it is going to be worse. Besides, let's be honest, people are going to vote for the sake of voting, because they don't investigate the candidates or anything, it's always been like that. Pity"
"Support for reform, we need magistrates and judges who work and do it for the benefit of justice and the people."
To run those corrupt judges
"To begin with, it is the Federal PJ, the State Judicial Branch will remain the same, Ministers, Magistrates and Judges by popular election? man, the Federal PJ is going to become a popularity contest instead of a Judicial career where the most prepared and capable are the ones who reach those positions"
"There in the court they are full of family members, and many years in the service. That is what the critics of this regime know, but how about the deputies and senators already seem to be inheritance for them those spaces, positions and I do not say it, this is how Chango Leon repeats every time he throws a tantrum. Aloi is a clear example of the coins. The whole family in politics, not even if he says about others that no one wants to talk. Greetings."
"Are those all the changes, no mmen, by reducing the amount to 9 out of 11 and having a limitation on the salary are people making such a fuss?"
"Unfortunately, little by little, Mexico is going to become the new Venezuela.
I hope I'm wrong"
"How are they going to be elected by the people, if the majority of us are ignorant in legal matters.
It's ridiculous"
My God wue webmake your perfect and holy will millions of amens millions of amens millions of amenes millions of amenes millions ee amoebes
But how can I throw for someone if I don't know how to write well or read
All those people don't earn that amount.. they earn more or less ten times the amount mentioned and the mayor earns millions and millions. . And the people get it very easy
I don't know how to know anything about this.... knowing how to bark at the Messiah is the only thing that is concerned
15 to 12? God!! It should be 3 or 4!! 12 is too many!
"That's very good!! In the little I understand, they are cutting off the heads of all the "
"At last what the people are asking for is heard. Well, he is the one who pays them. We are fed up with so much luxury that these people give themselves at the expense of the people"
"For those who think that currently judges are not elected by the people, they are mistaken, if they are technically elected by the people, because they are elected by the senate, and the senate is the representation of the people"
Because no one talks about the fact that the only coherent reason for making this decision is to put judges and magistrates in charge of the approval of MORENA and allies? They make up the majority of Congress and now they want to have the magistrate in their power...
"Since I stopped thinking, and I stopped complaining, and I stopped having occurrences"
"Well, it looks good"
"ALWAYS CHAN GO LEO N NO ROÑA ON STAGE!?, BATHED OR NOT BATHED, ,,IS IT TO SCARE THE AUDIENCE??"
Absusrdo
"The public domain orders you not to move anything in the judiciary.... you are our worker, by the way, very treacherous to the homeland"
Claudia chema entered with a set of justice to assert justice the Mexican tried the former president bankers and inpresarios
What does the impostor do.. Haaaaaa what he knows how to do better lie
If you are not stupid..
"The judiciary must maintain the independence of the other two. And the most prepared and ethical must be there, not the popular ones. And the prejidente boasts that he can, in the short time his results."
"The train will no longer stop moving, There's no way to smooth its march, Jethro Tull"
Let's clean house!!!
That is throwing away the nation's money
"Please don't put that guy anymore, let us rest from seeing and hearing that guy 6 years old, it didn't stain me I was disgusted"
"You comment on what is already happening today, you described the reality of all those who unfortunately know the unfortunate actions of the current judicial system."
Judges more than anyone else should be judged with the full weight of the law when they fail to comply with their functions or take advantage of it. The judiciary is crying out for a reform but based on the law and not on the change of hands of privileges.
"If in so many years they have acted out of favoritism and corruption. It is definitely time to do something about it, starting by adjusting so many economic privileges and power
They are public servants. 
Get to work!!"
The worst criminals free by the power of money.
"The people in power should be studied, prepared people, with ethical and moral principles and values; not people who are elected by ""popular vote"""
All support for the division of powers
"I don't know anything about politics, nor do I understand the powers that be, but this Mr. took me out of ignorance a little. Thank you"
"I wonder if the current system is already so ""good"", why there are innocent people in prison and criminals free ???"
"If I also received a salary 3 times greater than that of the President and they wanted to take it away from me, I would also attack this reform with violence and predict that it would be the end of the world if it is approved"
"IT'S GOOD THAT HE TALKS ABOUT THE REFORM, EXCELLENT VIDEO."
"I have really been hearing for days about the reform of the judicial power. So far I took the time to listen to the video 
Congratulations on the explanation, you took away many doubts.
The truth is that I do not have much knowledge, it is important to know to give an opinion on a subject 
Thanks for the information"
"I loved the explanation. Something like that I understood. As a law student, teachers should explain themselves like this. Without filler words, everything is clear, good volume and diction. Excellent explanation."
"It is important that citizens can trust the judiciary, now many of us do not trust. Now they operate in favor of criminals, they are not independent."
"I like his way of narrating history, laws and giving the pros and cons of our laws"
Why do they oppose the reform of the judiciary if thanks to it the Mexican people are getting better and better ??? Is the best sense what gave us hope ?
"If a judge is corrupt, he should go to prison, no suspending him. Carsel and/or death penalty for corruption."
"Thanks for the explanation! Good video, I wish everyone saw it that way, not that Morena or López Obrador, this is not about that or it should not be about that, but about impartial solutions, that is justice, I wish all Mexicans were critical and did not get carried away by a political party"
"Any change is better than what we are experiencing right now.
I do want a change and if that is not the right one, let them make another and another until the best for the people is reached."
Excellent information. Thanks a lot.
I invite you to read the comments haha the town is a lot of piece the net....
"Very clear and concise explanation, hopefully you understand the magnitude of the problems that this disastrous change would entail!"
"THAT THERE IS CÁCERL ALSO FOR THEM AND EVEN MORE, WATCH THEM WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS SO THAT THEY DO NOT SELL THEMSELVES !! IT WILL BE VERY COMPLICATED, BUT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO END SO MANY PRIVILEGES THAT THEY HAVE!!"
What a good explanation!!! Congratulations 
"Video summary: Maybe, risk, it would happen, enough is enough! Let's give a chance for change, we are fed up with the poor administration of justice."
"I am not a lawyer but I believe that the Judiciary has always been politicized, involved in matters of economic interests, political etc., the people have always suffered from the lack of application of justice, increase in organized crime for not applying the law, etc etc. so there is no evil that does not come from good"
"Corruption has nothing to do with age or experience. However, work experience, criteria and common sense are necessary."
"Friend...

Good video 
Thank you for sharing the info..
Greetings daddy"
"Thanks for the explanation, this one is true. MOVEMENT well said. Corruption has increased, imposition of violations of the constitution and appointing people as they please."
"Excellent information, thank you very much."
"I believe that before making the change to the judiciary he should first fight the prosecutors' offices, as you see in Sinaloa, its governor etc..."
Excellent analysis thank you very much and good channel 
I loved your explanation 
Those who are already used to their compadres of justice are the ones who argue for changes and I believe that a change for the good of the majority is the best
Thank you very much for opening the field to me with this detailed explanation! 
It must be done because the root of corruption comes from those who are supposed to fight crime and corruption.
Very good video! I wish everyone could see it!
"If the executive and legislative powers are elected by popular vote, I don't see why they shouldn't also elect those of the judiciary, they want to defend their so-called autonomy to continue doing their own thing."
Great explanation. Thank you so much for sharing!
"I am in favor of judicial reform, Mexico is evolving and this must reason to its core, judges must also submit to change."
"When you are deaf and blind we will report what is convenient for the benefit but in the past six-year terms the parties in power put and chose the ministers at their convenience, the mockery is in the excess of benefits that those at the top have and that grant protection to corrupt, politicians, drug traffickers, millionaire tax evaders and so on to those who have the money to defend themselves"
That the reform be approved.
"If necessary, the trials are very long and then they always end up defending the criminals"
"THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.
NO.. NO.. TO THE REFORM."
"Perfect as you explained it. Understandable everything, thank you very much!"
"Very good explanation but with all that please look just to give us an idea..... Only here in this small video on the subject how many of us are in favor of the reform, the comments speak for themselves !! We are the majority !! We are fed up with so much injustice of so many innocent prisoners and so many criminals on the loose, change is imminent and necessary !!
In favour!!!!"
"It's not just the president, it's all the people, eighty million Mexicans"
Very well explained
"That they earn less and do not charge even for breathing, she told them from experience, I am a lawyer and they are very corrupt"
Thanks for the information.
"I believe that we can give the opportunity to the new reform, we have been years under this form of justice, let's have the openness of this new change, they say that the changes are good. We don't lose anything by trying."
Thank you
"Hire more people in district courts. The proposed reforms are absurd, all absurd, if they do not hire personnel in district courts"
They are excellent proposals
"DISSEMBLE, HIS COVER FOR THE CHANGES PROPOSED BY AMLO IS NOTORIOUS"
"We are going for reforms, that is why we voted"
"THE REFORM IS GOING BECAUSE IT GOES, THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF SEEING HOW MANY PRIVILEGES THOSE OF THE JUDICIARY ENJOY AND THEIR WORK IS VERY BAD, THE PEOPLE RULE, AND THEN THOSE OF THE JUDICIARY DANCED THE CALMS"
The best thing is that there is a purge of judges and magistrates and that there are new criteria.
"You are absolutely right, Mr."
"The current judges turn a blind eye to serious problems in the country, corruption, drug trafficking, what about the 43 normalistas, the case of the massacre of 68, the mining concessions in indigenous communities, which now they do want to do things well"
"Even if they have no experience, they only have to stick to the construction to be able to impart pleasure and not pay attention to moches or political powers"
"And the worst thing is to leave the governed defenseless against the laws and arbitrary acts of authority. Self-applying and hetero-enforcing laws without any defense to the governed, I think that here they want to justify the ignorance required in the 4th or protect criminals"
"This reform will be the greatest boost that our country needs, for explosive and higher quality investment, it clears the way for us with greater security of our assets in all its versions, business operations, labor relations, investments, property, physical integrity, conflict resolution, removing vices, mafias and deformations in the exercise of administration and administration of justice. At last a ray of light on the dark path of corruption and impunity. LONG LIVE MEXICO, LONG LIVE MEXICO, LONG LIVE MEXICO."
"It is important to maintain the complete and total autonomy of the judiciary, the INE and the INAI."
I learned something new thank you.
"Support for change, we must bet on a new revolutionary step in ideas that can change the precarious system and favoritism of some"
Thank you. The information is very clear.
"This is the reform, because that way it is checked who really does their work and does not go around throwing the ball "
"CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUDICIARY!!!. For all the cases of innocent people who are in jail without a sentence, for all the guilty who are out of jail because in the courts they were lazy and did not review the evidence and files well, for all the guilty freed who pay for their freedom to judges, magistrates and lawyers...."
"Good video, greetings Emilio"
"The people asked for judicial reform and Article 39 is very clear that says that the people decide their way of modifying, annulling all types of management of the government, so I don't see any other way to cancel this request of the people, who were almost 36 million people, and they don't look for it anymore, the people decided, French, they would have done that before"
A change is always good if to reform.
"Hello, I understand what you think of the reform, but let's be honest, inequality was not caused by the government, but by the ministers, who are the ones who should make a counterweight and the only one who should apply justice and equality, do not want to tell us that we have a rule of law without having their privileged"
"Thank you very much for your involvement, I did not know anything about your reform that has already been approved"
"I only want the good for all Mexicans, and this reform will make us cry"
"Good evening to all the elements that make up this group and that only a few of us love by conviction this uniform of being ? Preventive Police and Municipal Traffic Officers of this municipality and is for the 125 municipalities of the state
From Jalisco and for the municipalities that make up our Mexican Republic 

Point number 1

In the Judicial Reform 

? 

Instead of 11 ministers, there are only 9

That proposal is fine 

2 Observation that the life pension be eliminated 

That is fine because, unfortunately, Mexican citizens, those who do not work in the municipal, state or federal government, have to work until the age of 65 in order to access a pension 

And it is disastrous unless they have the economic capacity to be able to acquire modality 40 to be able to retire with a higher salary 

Observation number 3: that ministers and judges are popularly elected, this proposal is good, and there is the controversy that they will be managed by corruption by organized crime 

But it is already known that this cannot be removed 

And it is good since each citizen is free to vote and to elect their rulers, in this situation they elect the new judges and ministers 

And the one who obtains the highest number of votes will be able to last in office from 10 years to 14 years 
  
On this point, if the reform is so, I agree 

But everyone is free to think differently 

Here are these three important constitutional articles and I hope that you analyze them and give me your point of view 

God bless you good night"
EXACTLY? to
If I agree with the Reform
"Here in the United States, when a criminal commits a crime, he is not only judged by a judge, but also by the people, that means that as an American caretaker, once a year you are chosen to go to court and be part of the court. They choose approximately 60 citizens and the judge analyzes them to see if they are fit to try the accused and based on that they end up choosing about 10 of the 60. It seems to me a fair system."
"VERY INTERESTING VERY WELL EXPLAINED FOR THOSE OF US WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT

IT HAS GOOD CHANGES AND OTHERS NOT SO MUCH,"
"Yes, I agree with the president that everything be changed, block in the judiciary all those who are now with a letter"
"The judiciary is not for a few, it is not a place let's remove excessive expenses excessive salaries, it is the service of the people."
Starting with those in Mexico City.
"I really like the way you explain this licensed issue, for me it is very important to know who is governing and so I will know who to vote for for the next one 
I have another important point 
I would like you to tell us about support for people with disabilities because apparently only Morena voters or relatives receive this support and I say this because I know it particularly"
All the Mexican people want to compensate in the first place with the rotten raises of the current Judicial Power.
"JUDGES are very prepared and dedicated people to serve, because they have the vocation and training to help those who need justice without being given a line of what they should do.    If what they say that there are some corrupt people, then let them use the path of Justice, who accuses them, present evidence and individually judge them with their due process.  but without a complaint everything is mere gossip and defamation.  The people we study do not pay attention to this type of slander I BELIEVE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF POWERS AND THAT THE THREE POWERS SHOULD NOT FALL ON A SINGLE PERSON, AS THE CONSTITUTION SAYS ART.41"
Yes to judicial reform. We are with Q4
It is not only AMLO. Those of us who voted for Morena also want that reform... It is not against workers of the harmful power. Only against corrupt judges and magistrates
"Yes, that the magistrates and judges be purged and that all the bad things that are currently being corrected, that the new generations be given a chance."
I am in favor of the Reform of the Judiciary
Very interesting!!!
"More than people who are prepared and have a high level of studies in the best universities in the world, the judges of the supreme court must have.. principles, values, humility, love for the people and the most needy, impartiality and discipline, but of course, above all, to be fair and honest, BUT FOR THEM ALL THIS IS FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT IS FROM EXTRATERRESTRIALS. for they will never be able to give what they do not have"
I think that the change in the judiciary is good since the people stopped believing in the judiciary a long time ago.
The judiciary needs to be reformed
"THE POINT THAT TOUCHES ON FREE ADVICE ALREADY EXISTS, IT IS THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS, A FREE DEFENSE LAWYER IS GRANTED TO THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR ONE"
"Justice closer to the People. Now there is more direct democracy or authentic democracy.... What we have to do is to promote awareness about the justice system and that goes from schools, homes, which is transversal."
"Good morning, of course it's wrong, I don't understand anything about politics.
So with her explanation she is VERY exquisite, thank you God bless us"
Total support for our dear president AMLO AMLO AMLO
"I already understood that they are not going to work if there is no wool involved, as they are used to, and the dinosaurs do not want to be displaced, but there is a lot of reason in the president, we have to give way to the best prepared youth and it is okay the shorter they last, the less they are mistreated, to eradicate corruption.   Well done AMLO"
"The capture of the Judiciary by the Government is clear, the bar associations should propose candidates whose condition would be proven capacity and honesty...."
"What must be reformed from beginning to end must be all political positions: from the presidents to the lowest positions of the executive and legislative (both chambers) at the national level and eliminate the immunity of politicians (perhaps also all the armed forces) to dismiss, prosecute and sentence to serve sentences in prison and not in house arrest. in addition, not to hold any political office again. The risks are very dangerous for the country: A militarized and fascist narco-state"
"Let's go with the reform of the judiciary, it will be achieved!!"
"We have always voted for corrupt presidents who make us think that we can vote for many judges, magistrates and ministers that we will not get to know, that they will have to be part of a political party and what it generates in expenses in votes etc, if there are options in favor of the citizens but it is to hook us that it is to improve,  because they don't dedicate more time to making decisions, because so quickly we don't all know in detail the issue of the judiciary but I wouldn't give Claudia more power for this six-year term,
The judiciary must be independent, let's not accept reform."
"Good afternoon Mr. I did not manage to hear your name but I thank you that thanks to you I know my state, you could take a tour of the San Juan de Aragón unit the house where you grew up was on the consulate river and tlacos is the only thing I remember because they swallowed me to california very small Mr. thank you very much DLB ?"
"Do not confuse people, the popular vote for ministers and judges does not need to belong to any party, remember that also today both ministers and judges also pursue the interests of both parties and the minority. With the reform, the same SCJN will be in charge of summoning the candidates for candidacies and in conjunction with the INE such as the TEPJF and CJF. The political act of a political power should not be minimized. The CPEUM indicates that we are a democratic and representative country, with this refusal to submit to the popular vote it is already any case of unconstitutionality, which is being promoted by the same Judiciary when it is up to it to defend"
The Reform is very good. It is many millions of pesos for the judiciary.
"They must take away their privileges, their jobs, but above all their titles and the right to exercise again.  

They have mocked the people of Mexico for decades and it is they who pay for their excesses."
The problem is that citizens do not know how to vote 
If the judicial reform were the corrupt judges and magistrates
"If he wanted to improve the country, he injected resources with good administration into education and health."
"Don't worry. In the worst case, with the corruption and trickery of those who arrive, in the event of the failure of this new paradigm, they would be at odds with what is happening today, therefore, it would be just as rotten as the current judiciary. The worst thing would be not to try something to find an efficient and honest body. You, sir, are skewing the information."
"Political Constitution of the United Mexican States.
Article 39.- National sovereignty resides essentially and originally in the people. All public power emanates from the people and is instituted for their benefit. The people have at all times the inalienable right to alter or modify the form of their government."
"Well, I don't know why there is so much fuss, if it is well known that those who are already there are corrupt, it is not noticeable"
EXCELLENT VIDEOS
11:41 It is believed and it is a reality that judges are influenced by political interests!!  Politics is a lost cause.
"IT IS TIME TO PUT AN END TO THE JUDGES WHO DO NOT DISPENSE JUSTICE AND TAKE CARE OF BUSINESSMEN WHO OWE THOUSANDS OF PESOS TO THE SAT, AN EXAMPLE IS SALINAS PLIEGO"
We cannot and should not underestimate the new generations
"Every public office must be elected by the people, period!"
"Politicians should be the best prepared people in academic matters and not only to speak and convince. As in any job in the private sector, they must have a curriculum and profile suitable for the performance of the position they are going to occupy, otherwise any donkey is in charge of a country, a state and that is why Mexico continues to be a fifth-class country"
"It is really a bwue dream in Quintana Roo, to stop the corruption and lawsuits of organized crime"
"In Spain, a similar measure was promoted by the socialist party, where through it different political deals have been agreed with the purpose of keeping the socialist party in power, although this even goes against constitutional principles."
"We want a change of judges, those who are corrupt are from the PRIAN"
"Well, hopefully it will be fulfilled.!! We are already locked from so much corruption in Mexico"
The Public Defender's Office already exists
"This gentleman is defining the current work of those who work as judges and magistrates today... We have to see how the new law comes, because we are not doing well"
"In reality, today, they are at the service of criminals or in the best of cases of those who come to them at the price. Best regards"
"If you agree that many of us have civil cases, family cases pending and that thanks to all these protests it is being delayed..."
Yes to the reform of the judiciary and jail for pineapple and other corrupt PRI members
"Thank you for your explanation, the most excellent!. clear and precise.. Poor Mexico, and its people do not stop all this! There is a good saying that no one learns in someone else's head "
"It would be very good if they made transparent how much income tax is withheld from the workers of the Judicial Branch, almost half of those who pay them are deducted from taxes."
"Of course, you are for the reform of the judiciary, enough of corruption at the highest levels of justice."
The.    Power.    Judicial.       Must.       Be.      Autonomous.       And.      Without.       Invaders.     Of the.     Power.    Legislative.        Nor.    Executive.        Like this.     Of.     Simple
"AND WHO WILL SANCTION THE PRESIDENT, GOVERNORS AND MUNICIPAL PRESIDENTS. AND ALL HIS HENCHMEN"
I agree that I know the vote of the people as a democracy when electing judges and magistrates as it happened by hand to pineapple and many who are there
No to the dictatorship we want a free Mexico as always
"Mr. with all the respect that you deserve me. Nowadays everything that you are announcing or communicating already exists. Whether the reform is done or not, I am almost sure that everything will remain the same."
"It is not bad that society puts judges, so it has to be everywhere, because a full democracy is not only to go to vote, but that society also has control over all things state, which is also ultimately the one that puts the money so that they pay all of them, I never saw that in my life that the one who finances has no right to anything,  What's more, it seems that they steal money, it only happens in the public sector because in the private sector the rules are different, it is time for society to begin to become aware that the body can have control of everything and move towards a true democracy!"
"That is democracy, electing judges and ministers and so the poorest also have the right to fair and free trials, no more judges put by hand long live morena"
Excellent
"The election by popular vote of the ministers is already a sufficient reason not to accept it, and even less so with the recent occurrence of the tenant in the national palace to eliminate the judicial and labor experience"
"I think that instead of providing free advice 
They should purge the dependencies so that there is no more corruption and they take it out on the most vulnerable"
"This commentator why did you not make those comments 6 years ago, you received economic support from the executive branch. If not, why do we Mexicans never hear these comments, why do they so far speak out in favor of the executive branch? There are millions of us who recognize Amlo's patriotism"
Excellent information
"Too bad, but everyone is very happy with the social support and as long as this is the case, there will be no criticism of power."
"We can't be worse anymore, I'm in favor of reform"
"Whether you vote or not, it is already proven that the old finger does not work, so try the vote."
La reforma no se detiene sigueeeeeeeeeeee
Already as a source of approval of AMLO's judicial reform and a goat barbecue of happiness alive amlo and his reform
"The application is very clear, I hope to be attentive so as not to be too serrated and to understand by the application it is clear that what is happening in our MEXICO is not very good"
"Avoid at all costs that judges and magistrates remain in office forever, set a time limit"
?????????????????? that everything is for the good of Mexico and for the good of Mexicans
"Judges and ministers must work for the people, as it is known that the people pay their salaries, but all over the world I see that only the rich have privileges of justice, I think that only in the United States is justice applied."
"Excellent exposure.
MEXICO is going from bad to worse"
The video is very biased. A pity. Best regards
"on paper everything sounds very good, the issue is that they are proposals and there are no work plans to deal with such frequent rotations in the changes of powers,
the intention of bringing young blood to important positions as well, but there is still that risk factor of taking advantage of the vulnerabilities that a lack of experience can generate. 

Let's hope that there are more details in the work plans and not only in a vote of confidence because personally that no longer exists towards politicians."
"It doesn't matter what is done and who we choose, as long as we continue to live in this system, the consumption format will not improve, it is a complicated issue that most citizens cannot understand and even if they have access it is to take advantage and wash their hands blaming the people. We can change this format without the need for a leader, we have technology to come together and build a creative society based on creative principles, not consumer"
How interesting that what can happen with the reform has been happening for decades in our country
His future is assured
That's it. Better. What. A. Taken out. Ministers. Judges and. Director Norma Piña
"Impunity and rights are very serious and from what I hear with inexperienced young people, it will be stronger, how sad, judges and ministers also need to be evaluated for their performance. Take away rights from those who do not deserve them."
For it is the bill that decides whether you are guilty or innocent that you agas what you agas
"In favor of the Judicial Reform, it has been more than demonstrated over the years how they have benefited corrupt businessmen, it is time for change and of course it hurts them to stop earning the money of salaries in addition to their good bribes"
"CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS, CONGRATULATIONS, NOW TIME CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS,,,"
"I am in favor of the judiciary. In any case, the judiciary has never really served."
"We also need reforms in the executive and legislative branches, such as reducing by half the legislators and senators and also reducing the financing of these political parties and also only two political parties and not one more and demanding from the president in turn the campaign promises as he said and repeated that he was going to end crime in the first six months of his term and he has not fulfilled and health there Nor has he complied, a refinery that does not refine either, judge the former presidents and has not complied and so on he has done pure whims such as continuing to indebted the country and pure puppets in the Legislative and Senate which he manipulates at will since they do not have their own will, the same we need dependencies that control and monitor the president and legislators and senators on what they spend the money on and render accounts because in the end of accounts, both the president and legislators and senators and others are only employees and public servants and let López Obrador be clear that he is not the owner of the Mexican reputation or of Mexicans, etc."
"I am against the reform of the judiciary, my support is totally for the magistrates, they are people who have years of very prepared and brilliant experience, that people vote for them to elect them ??? That is a serious mistake"
"This is how it has been taught all the time for impunity, it is better to have a new stage and the changes must be for the people and at the service"
"The public defender's institute is interesting, it already exists but it is not always possible for everyone to have access to this advice, even some offices such as the state DIF take advantage of this situation and legal advisors use public offices as their offices and take cases by the individual instead of sending people to the ombudsman's office. They should also put an end to these practices that the only beneficiaries are them, using the offices as if they were private offices and they also already receive a salary"
"Having a precedent on the failures of these reforms in other countries, let's also be honest, in our country there is a high level of abstentionism when it comes to voting, what awaits us and guarantees that the right people will be elected to oversee the administration of justice? In addition, the more experience a person has, it helps them to have better decisions, because they have studied and weighed more situations, I do not consider that they are easy to manipulate, you have to be alert and participate because a very important decision is at stake, because this brings a domino effect."
Excellent video to demonstrate how a media outlet can be bought to subtly try to dirty the real objective of the reform of the judiciary.
"I say Q is a good idea, the current judges don't work Well, it's better to make a drastic change!!"

"That Judicial Reform is very bad. We went through many reforms but that judicial reform did not. The workers are not to blame, the workers with their sleepless nights, sometimes without rest, a lot of work, sometimes up to three days in a row of work without seeing their families, working until two, three in the morning, several days and only because of a judicial reform are they going to take away their jobs? They are supposed to only be for judges, magistrates and all those corrupt people at the top, not for the workers."
"I agree with the change, there is a lot of mismanagement by the magistrates, that this monopoly be ended"
"Excellent explanation, there are pros and cons, but I consider that the popular vote should not be, because justice cannot be inclined by convenience towards whoever is in power, thanks for the explanation"
"We are Mexico, we have to wait. So many reforms that others have made and, no one said anything there. Adjustments can be made"
"The point of electing ministers and magistrates by vote already exists, THEY ARE ELECTED BY THE SENATORS, WHEN THE THREE CANDIDATES SENT BY THE PRESIDENT ARE ELECTED, THAT IS, THE PRESIDENT AND SENATORS ARE ELECTED THROUGH THE VOTE.  which the people have already given them the power to elect these officials, therefore THEY ARE ELECTED BY VOTE.  THIS IS CALLED INDIRECT VOTING
ARTICLE 76 OF CONSTITUTION"
"You excel in professionalism master communicator and in the previous six-year terms, not to mention"
"A branch of Venezuela, alert Mexicans!"
I always thought that reform was bad. But it's terrible!!!! This country went to hell!
"My condolences to the beautiful Mexican people, so many mirrors to see and they didn't."
"May he be trustworthy with humanity, humility and loyalty"
"Thank you Mr. Emilio for the good information, the process to carry out this election, this super complicated, each idea without a good organization"
I fully support the reform and the end of the privileges of the judiciary
"full support for the reform, it was taken away, the blanket was removed, they ran out."
15 years not even the president stays that long
"I only know that the prison is full of people who could not afford a lawyer and that is why he supported the new reform. And if foreign investment wants to leave, then it is only a sign that it hurts them to no longer be able to bite corrupt judges."
I don't know why so much fear of change and losing power.
"No political aims. Nor a supporter of any political party.  My opinion is, I support that reform, from what I have experienced and justice is seen in the country, all the judges who are now being proposed and appointed by former presidents and the current president, I do not share that, they owe it to them and they would work for them. The explanation or my argument is very simple, in everyday life if they do me a favor, I have to return the favor, it is reciprocal.  
In this sense, proposing judges is the same, the executive cannot take charge of that issue, and finally with his video I already know which side he is on "
"They have always been the rules of the crime in question, now if like 2 ministers they are about to disappear now their interests for them please"
"For now, judges and magistrates, and probably also ministers, are influenced by groups in political and economic power and enjoy many privileges without doing their job or deserving any privileges as they do now
Wouldn't it be better if they were elected to reduce those influences??"
It is worth listening to without angry and insulting criticism.
Immediately the judicial reform
"LET'S NOT BE FOOLS, WE KNOW VERY WELL THAT THIS BODY IS GOOD BUT WELL ROTTEN, WE HAVE KNOWN IT FOR A LONG TIME, EVERYONE COMPLAINS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN ALL AREAS, SO WHY DO THEY NOT WANT THE REFORM ??? ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS A LOT OF WASTE OF RESOURCES, WITH SO MANY PRIVILEGES THAT THEY HAVE, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH LEVELS, ENOUGH OF PRIVILEGES OR ALL COLLUDES OR ALL TAILS."
"DEATH TO CORRUPTION, NEPOTISM, CLASSISM, RACISM, OSTENTATIOUS LUXURIES FOR THE DAMNED DIVINE CASTE OF THE TOGA CARTEL."
Crocks out. Well done mexico congrats on the reform.
"CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUDICIARY!!!. For all the cases of innocent people who are in jail without a sentence, for all the guilty who are out of jail because in the courts they were lazy and did not review the evidence and files well, for all the guilty freed who pay for their freedom to judges, magistrates and lawyers...."
Very well explained
Thanks for the information
"CORRUPT PEOPLE OUT OF THE JUDICIARY!!!. For all the cases of innocent people who are in jail without a sentence, for all the guilty who are out of jail because in the courts they were lazy and did not review the evidence and files well, for all the guilty freed who pay for their freedom to judges, magistrates and lawyers...."
"Of course, we agree on the changes that are going to be seen, so many white-collar criminals are free."
"That reform has to be carried out if or if enough of the mockery, now the proposals are right, there is no equality in the courts, all judges and magistrates have never been at the service of the people"
6:30 Those who should earn the most are primary and secondary school teachers.
Also to give the opportunity to the right to the rank to the officials who deserve it because by handing or selling the position many do not move up the position and I think that the fair thing is that they let people who demonstrate capacity and honesty within the courts move up the position
"Does anyone know what an unconstitutional act is?
What is a constitutional controversy? 

What the opposition is doing is distorting so that they do not take away their judges. They are crying for their salary and because they will no longer be a nest of nepotism and corruption."
This is how it has to be with the new reform
"Yes, it is correct that there are qualified people with experience in these positions, but it is also important that there is an agency that regulates them in order to avoid corruption, nepotism and that the magistrates enrich themselves and enjoy privileges as a result of corruption."
"But in the reform indicates that not everyone will be able to participate in these elections, the best judges will be chosen and they will participate, it also indicates that there will be no budget to raise their campaigns, they will only participate in small debates with a time limit, which is very good, and in any case it is useful for Andrés Manuel López Obrador to stay in power if he is almost gone,  That argument does not make sense, the consensus is to have more transparent judges and of course that people can be included in these aspects since these organizations are paid with public taxes, and these organizations have thrown against many reforms that help the weakest sectors, it is true that this reform may need to be polished but it can be done in the future."
"The correct thing to do is to make designation by STATISTICS. That those who are there, ministers, magistrates, judges, defenders, councils report how many lawsuits they received in 1 year. How many of those they resolved. How many were rejected by superior. Including international courts. The best continue to work. There must be FREE local, federal and international ombudsmen's offices. **Strict SURVEILLANCE. ??"
"And perhaps all the Ministers have or had a judicial career, for example De la Mora, Alfredo Ortiz Mena, he did not even make his speech when he was appointed and helped in the election of his cousin-in-law as Magistrate (Otero) another who did not even have experience as an official, I could name him many who are on the right hand starting with Norma Piña,  There is no worse blind.."
"The reform is perfect, so in the judicial power of Jalisco they get to work, from my own experience I tell you the agents of the prosecutor's office are of no use especially those of group 5 
They almost wanted me to take the accused and they are still annoyed by me talking to them about constitutional articles fence judicial power"
"This is the basis of a different Mexico, the 4 is laying the first stone"
That is good that there are lawyers who help low-income people
"Why did he do it when he took power, lower salaries, reduce deputies and senators, remove useless expenses from the Senate chamber, in his six-year term there was a lot of corruption, more with the police, he did not ask to control anything, he renounced his pension as president or he will say like the others that he earned it"
"The system is more than obsolete, it needs to be modified"
"But the People do not know the judges, how could they vote correctly? Imagine the public spending on advertising to go to popular election, I think this is a bad proposal"
"We don't know if it will work as promised by that change, but what I am convinced of and with proof!! It is that today the system is rotten and it is no longer a viable option to access Justice, and the worst thing is that my personal experience has been through 2 female district judges!!! It is a shame that it is the gender that fights the most for recognition that I have had to see in such a degrading role, since this same trial that has been in litigation for more than years and that involves minors (which the law is supposed to protect to the maximum) has behaved more decent male judges than women.  but it is still a system dominated by Corruption in a cynical way in which there is nothing defensible anymore."
What hurts them the most is their retirement and their salary
"It is good to publicize the new reforms, what I see as bad is that they should not give an opinion on what it means or what it affects because there is a bias in the interpretation of the content."
"The justice system in Mexico has always been rotten, the reform of the judiciary sounds risky, but if we don't do something different, it will always be the same result."
I do not agree with his personal assessments. Change is necessary.
We have. Personnel. Prepared. Stop. Work. In. The. Power. Judicial.. The. Rot. Ba. Pa. Outside..
We must try to make a change and give an opportunity to know if it works
"If Ricardo Anaya and the gringos oppose this reform, then we can conclude that the reform is in the interest of the people."
"I have a mother who works in judicial city she and her husband are hiding my teeth in the Ministry of Health and I have a deduncis in the prosecutor's office and she and her husband have levers and they are blessing me with the petsona who is hiding me midentida I have four years fighting my espediente is very chiuco quiro jistic the person who is osupando my place is Alicia Gierrero Gonzalez I want them to investigate my folder

15:39 of agreement to sell my work in the Ministry of Health I is 15:39 e dencia by prosecutor's office and my experience is crooked with his palsnca I could not j
Do nothing they are stealing my name and I have four years fighting my identity"
"All support to judges and magistrates,"
"Do not be angry because of the wicked or envy those who do evil. They will wither as fast as grass; like tender green grass, they will dry up.  Put your hope in Jehovah and go his way, when the wicked are eliminated, you will see it.  Psalm 37:1, 2, 34.  .  .  ""Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. James 4:8. "
The change of the judiciary we no longer want jackals in that power
"Political Constitution of the United Mexican States.
Article 49.- The Supreme Power of the Federation is divided for its exercise into Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.

Two or more of these powers may not be combined in a single person or corporation, nor may the Legislative power be vested in an individual, except in the case of extraordinary powers to the Executive of the Union, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29. In no other case, except as provided for in the second paragraph of Article 131, shall extraordinary powers be granted to legislate."
"If there are nine ministers left, they can eliminate Lenia and the other person who does not have a title, so the magistrates would be complete"
"The only reform that the judiciary needs is that there be more courts in the common and federal jurisdictions. There are very few courts that exist for the thousands of lawsuits that there are every day.
Not the stupidity of reform proposed by the old man who claims to be the representative of the nation."
"In any case, there is impunity and if there is a reform or a proposed change it is better"
His disagreement with the judicial reform is very evident. But the people are no longer ignorant and thank you very much to Our President AMLO for thinking of the people who leave us with the foundations to rebuild what the previous CORRUPT governments destroyed and left us a Mexico INDEBTED and with an absence of JUSTICE.
Long live amloooo and out with corrupt judges and corrupt politicians long live the amlooo people think well future for the jobenes
"How impartial the one with the voice, you don't notice who he represents.
It is about making known what the Judicial Reform consists of, not giving their biased opinions."
"At the service of the people, as it should be, not at the service of criminals."
"Well, as it is, they don't play well, don't tell me that criminals don't manipulate them, because it's okay to change, if it's not better, you can't be worse than it is"
I would love too much if you were my professor
"The people who are not in favor of the reform, please know very well that most of those who are in power do not even have studies, many are by levers, here in my beautiful municipality those who work behind the city council do not know why they are there, but they are there because they are paid very well within the DIF, there are not even merely professional people even the psychologists do not even have a degree,  Not to mention the judicial troupe in marginalized communities the patrol passes by and if they see people just wanting to drink a beer they grab them and take them away as if they were criminals, I wish they did it with those who really are and if you don't want to stay locked up to fulfill your hours they prune the fine of 1500 that's the system. And I don't want to imagine in cities like CDMX"
"Good evening, regarding the years of experience it doesn't work either because I'm going to celebrate 9 years of modern cyberattack and they don't pay attention to me, they don't answer me and when I go they only bring me from one place to another. New ideals are needed from recent graduates who are not ill-fed. This is my opinion without offending anyone."
"Desperation to lose their privileges, that is what they are really fighting for, they even believe that they want something good for Mexicans, we need new people and not corrupt, stop doing harm to Mexico and withdraw"
"People who are critical and against the reform should propose another reform, give options to the people, because we are the most benefited and/or affected; It is clear that the Judiciary is not efficient, and does not have the confidence of the people, which it would supposedly lose."
"It makes me very sad, that they do not understand the division of powers, that is, they are independent, rather they were, to say yes you. You do not agree with something or if you committed a crime, but you will find the ideals of the executive they are going to prosecute you, vezuela style, they mock and make jokes but do not say that they were not reprimanded"
"You also mention the salaries, privileges and that they are at the service of large businessmen, tax evaders, etc. You talk as if everything was going well with the judiciary, they already have too much time in power doing very bad administration of justice"
We don't want another Maduro in Mexico! Down with the Reform proposed by AMLO
Vote for the corrupt long live Claudia prrecidenta canbio to the judiciary
"Let them change all those judges, but they are useless."
"It's true, let us hear it all of Mexico, let all those who have already become rich leave and let new ministry's judges come and don't stay indefinitely for the most 9 years only, there are people who want to stay all their livesABUSIVE"
"Let the corrupt fuckers end.
Now justice is being done"
"in medical jargon it is said that an old doctor is better than a young one, experience is necessary,"
"By popular vote it should not be. That a council of experts is in charge of doing it, sadly the people are easy to manipulate. 
Nor should they be young people without experience, those are the first to fall on the wings of any party that buys them. Right Kumamoto ??"
"The separation of powers,,,, has never existed in Mexico,,,,,,judicial independence,,,, either,,,,,the president has been the master,,,,,, we should try to change a little,,,,, for future generations"
Good review
"The judiciary is so perverted that it needs to happen.
The law!! According to it is prompt and expeditious.
It's a terror!!"
No matter how or what corruption will never be lacking
"Ministers have always been chosen for convenience, only in these elections President Norma Piña and other judges with Alito Moreno, isn't it something cynical to criticize forgetting this background??"
I hope that the possibility of having the capacity to process international trials or resolutions will be contemplated in order to avoid legal isolation in Mexico.
"Whatever the change is, it is necessary and well. Hopefully. Everyone work. Well and have a good salary but not like those."
With money the ministers are letting several criminals go free
We agree with the president's proposal and enough of defending the corrupt
Comment on reforming their salaries and privileges and who plays the corrupt judges who protect Salinas Pliego
"I do not agree with everything the president does, but I totally agree that he should do it hopefully and it should be done.
And let it be now! As soon as possible."
"How are we going to elect the magistrates,,. . .  I think I fail him there!!"
"I think that the photo with López Obrador is enough, for many to believe that they are very good people, Excellent explanation, too bad that some do not understand it, Thank you for that very good contribution "
Good for Mexico
LONG LIVE MEXICO LONG LIVE AMLO
"It is good that he should be elected by the people and for the people to the cervicio, because those who are there are the cervicio of the rich and those of power."
"It is summarized and understood as a reform to pj as taking away all their privileges from these corrupt people, which is what they cry for.
!! THE REFORM IS GOING !!"
Ministers and judges are the worst currently how many judges have removed murderers today
Only the president wants the best and many are hurt because they will no longer have too much money and the country will not be affected at all
"And the ones right now don't have like-minded people, don't suck"
"It is Time to Have Everyone in the new 4T Transformation in favor it is time to break their corruptions and have a new system, the people are tired of maintaining the same for years and now that it is a good change they are already screaming ?? 4T??"
Out with the judges who extort money in the Chalco Valley
"This was my last hope of finding objective information about this reform of the judiciary, it started well but halfway through the video he began to make value judgments that clearly showed his political positions"
"That they don't get paid if they don't work and how do they never work? No fart
Blessed is the reform and has already the privileges."
"The people are the ones who should be listened to, we already voted because we want a change"
"The judges are more manipulated, if they are already manipulated, long live Mexico, long live amlo ????"
The ministers are already affiliated with power groups and they do not even hide it.
"I suppose that the applicants for those positions obviously it is because they have already presented tests such as degrees, licenses or any requirement to prove that they are highly qualified. To exercise the position to which they are aspiring;  that is, that they are true professionals in the field"
"The day that the death penalty is legal and we begin to get rid of all the rapists and those involved in organized crime, I would be a happy Mexican."
Ok
"Yes, there is a lot at stake but the truth is that we are not very good and everything is already politicized, in my town if you are not from the party in power and you ask for help they do not give it to you and there are people who did not even finish high school and do not know anything about laws and decide yes and no. Very unfair and now he asked me how complicated it is to run an entire country"
Long live AMLO's judicial reform die Norma Pina's judicial power 
Full support for Amlo
The opinion of the opposition does not matter because there is no seriousness in them. How long will there be a serious opposition 
"As a law student, they will be able to deceive and take advantage of those who are ignorant of the subject, but not of students or professionals, this reform is a political farce."
"How about it, because what is described is not very different from what is happening today, just look at the resolutions in Lozoya, Caro Quintero cases, and not to mention Ayotzinapa...."
"I think that in the same way they have been working in the past six-year terms and they show what he is commenting on, all those failures have already been experienced in this country, that is why he says it "
What a good move by our president
"The person speaking uses a crucial word, ""COULD."" so we still don't know if it will happen or not.
In what if there is no ""COULD"" is the current system, that system we all know does not work."
Experience is necessary in a public office as it will be possible for a young person without experience where decision-making is very important
"Who would have thought that today the judges and players are being judged, the truth is that this is good
We all know that for years the laws and justice were only for the rich those with money who could pay"
And that there are free lawyers for many people who cannot afford a lawyer is very common so there will not be so many lawyers who take advantage of people's situation
Out with that proposal out with it
"This law seems incongruous to me since currently judges and magistrates who have many years of training and as you say are looking for people who can be molded as the person who supported them and proven that they will do what they say. Which is not at all objective when it comes to imparting justice. But as it is fully seen, the president is very upset because they do not submit to his orders. Wake up Mexico."
I hope that everyone will continue to be in favor when the country and its citizens live as in Venezuela and Bolivia. Let's see if they continue to applaud AMLO.
"It is a pity I had confidence in the rapporteur, today I realize that he is partial in favor of those who have more and abuse the weak. He does not feel what the people suffer day by day.
That he says who he persecuted politically or judicially, or what corruption he is talking about, that of the PRI members or leonine businessmen?
Pity."
"Go ahead, Mr. President AMLO.
We who are the majority vote for a better Mexico where, those who have more or who have better influence do not predominate, unfortunately the judiciary is currently rotten, Morena is the majority that is why they won democratically, enough of so much corruption that the neo-liberal governments left us, come on Morena we are the majority!!!! People have already woken up!!!"
When I entered the video I thought you were going to list the reforms. Not to judge them.
"Well, with all due respect, but with all the privileges they have during their functions and their retirement, it is a mother's joke for everyone. If this reform is necessary."
Ministers favor bad guys anyway
"Why don't they understand, many don't understand that the world is changing and that the future of a country is no longer the old, it's the young here in the United States, all that is seen, from engineers, policemen, firefighters, there are people who are in charge of political positions and everything, to people who do personal jobs or jobs for normal people, for the people of the country are young, you have to understand the young people are the ones who are going to take over this country has to take care of the future"
"As if those problems you mention did not already exist. Impunity guaranteed.
This reform has to take place and naturally it does not have to be the definitive solution. But it is a good antithesis and a synthesis would come out of it."
With all respect for the president if they say that he is a dictator because he does not impose the reform of the supreme court of justice as previous presidents did
"The people proposed judicial reform, we are tired of injustice.
- The poor are imprisoned, disappeared
- To date there are no culprits of the real criminals, who disappeared at the 43 from Ayotzinapan 
- Judges defend those who pay the most money and some criminals have immunity
-Judges support crime. Genaro Luna a high-grade criminal that supposedly no one knew
- Enough is enough, urgent plan C"
"It is a clear example of polarization and perspective based on who holds power at the moment.
He talks about the risks that are run with the reform, about impunity, corruption, favoritism to various groups including drug traffickers, and the question is... does that not currently exist, criminals are not released, there is no corruption in judges and magistrates?
Another very ironic point. Is not a 5-year experience enough to exercise legislation and justice? Why revile the youth and its energy? How old were people like Francisco Zarco, the Flores Magón brothers, and so many others who with youth and energy promoted radical changes in the nation?
Those who today enjoy onerous privileges are victimized, when we live in a country where the victim is the people to whom justice does not reach: 'that lady does not visit the huts of the poor'.

This man assumes everything from his perspective, he describes the risks of a reform without realizing that what he describes is just what is lived today with the model of class and elitist justice.

That it be reformed?... Of course!
What do you propose?... also.

But with the much-vaunted 'wisdom' professed by this bunch of elitist magistrates that we have today, that they propose with a fine and genuine and disinterested criterion to their class, not that their illustrious proposal after the dialogue is to make a work stoppage, how ridiculous'.
With that they only demonstrate one thing that they have already made very clear... The exercise of justice does not interest them!, they are interested in preserving their interests, privileges, pensions, and leaving their 2nd, and even 3rd generation covered.

Up with Q4"
The truth is that it is better to try the reform because the judges and the whole system is very inefficient
"What are we going to celebrate from this September 15 if we are no longer going to be free.
Damn AMLI and its fourth transformation. 
So much so that he criticized past presidents and this has been the worst for Mexico. 
Please no to this reform. 
The people never asked to be more. 
The man speaks of austerity and equality, so let him and his children begin.
Hopefully the narco will disappear him"
"TO HAVE MATERIALIZED WHO DOES NOT BENEFIT CORRUPT MINISTERS, MAGISTRATES AND JUDGES APPARENTLY TO THE PEOPLE YES WHY NOT GET OUT SO SOON THE CRIMINALS AND VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE"
"No to the reform, but if they lower their salaries"
"I agree with the reform because there is a lot of violence in the family in the street because the judges do not put them, the judges catch them"
"In fact, this has always been done by corrupt judges who let the guilty go free. Hopefully now everything will change for the better with the new law"
"Mr. Pineda, with great respect for your preparation, I tell you that I do not agree with many of your conclusions.    You say that the executive is seeking to exert more control over the court.  How can this be if those eligible to be candidates for which the people can vote are evaluated by committees in the legislature and in the supreme court to compete. Also the committee that oversees the decisions of judges is composed of judges and not of the executive and not of the council of the judiciary which is composed of members of the judiciary with the president of the court as well as the president of the judiciary.   And why do you think that the election of judges by the people would be more likely that their decisions could be influenced by parties or gangsters?    How is there no such danger when electing senators and deputies and the president?"
Now they are interested in justice? In this country that word does not exist
It is assumed that if they are ministers they have to evaluate them to see if they qualify
above all the United States is very concerned
"A reform with many good intentions 
However, knowing the politicians and their great eagerness to lie, this can result in total oppression 
I don't know much about laws and mechanisms but is there a way to reverse this reform?"
"He is very, very bad, now it turns out that the judges are white popcorn, he is going to Chihuahua for a dance, the people spoke"
Let the reform go and the people will also be in charge of regulating it for its proper functioning!!
"But if the predecessors did nothing, what are you complaining about?"
"Curious that I mentioned that judges and ministers ""could be in collusion with certain political parties...... Precisely for that reason the reform is wanted by people like Norma Piña who meets with Alito, in a house that is, in the dark, if he liked to dialogue he would see it done in the public light...."
"I think the reform is perfect, it is an honor to be with a baker"
The record shows that it has never enjoyed autonomy and they were at the service of the executive.
"Corruption has always existed in all executive, legislative and judicial branches, they have always been like an auction whoever offers the most wins the case. I have seen it in my own flesh and also in the national guard. You don't even know who to believe in anymore..."
"If the judiciary does have to lower the salaries of ministers, the reform was based on"
Judges are bought in themselves
"I am a retired citizen without much knowledge of the judicial reform, with this video, it was clearer to me what it is about, thank you for this video, very well explained."
The approach of this narrative is clearly an opinion of the one who expresses it that is surely considered from a point of view. The glass is half full or half empty depending on my interests.
"The national institute of public defenders already exists. The same as the supervisory body of the judges, is the federal judicial council, rather it is intended to wrap the ignorance and ignorance of the people with these arguments. It is clear that these changes are not going to combat corruption but encourage it and expose undue interference in a power that does not correspond to it. All the judges would be appointed by the government, that cannot be!! A judge SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL, it goes against his nature."
"And who are the current judges and ministers? When they have made them known, has the judiciary functioned?"
"CHANGES ARE GOOD.

HE WHO DOES NOT RISK DOES NOT WIN.

IS THE HELL GOING FOR US? WELL, NOOO! WE ARE GOING TO FEEL IT "
Corrupt people out of the SCJN
"Not so much according to the least years of experience, but honestly justice in Mexico only favors the powerful NO MORE!! Forward with the reform, we health personnel every year must compete with each other to be the best and have more remuneration, earn our categories because the judiciary doesn't? Because they must reach almost 20 years to earn their millionaires and we are already left without pensions? Why are some public servants worth more than others?"
"FORMIDABLE CLARIFICATION OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY JOURNALIST, EXCELLENT ..."
"Autonomy of family power, will mean because they are pure family."
"With all respect, but they are already working like this because it has been shown because according to the statistics how many criminals have been released to perhaps you are part of or what is your interest in wanting to manipulate people, people who of course no longer believe them."
"Although that can happen or it could be the opposite, I think that we will have to rehearse and then we will be able to know if it works or not, otherwise I consider it manipulation of actions, I appreciate your attention"
"It tried with its infrastructures it did not work, it tried it with health and its new institutions and it failed, it is only crumbling what little we had and is turning us into Venezuela 2"
Total disagreement
They are currently at the service of those with greater economic resources
"Get out useless corrupt guys, new people, they will run out of gold mine.."
"Ok. And what about the corruption of prosecutors, police officers who are in favor of the government"
"Of course, there needs to be reform for all those points that are described and for them to do their work and function as they should be.   So many crimes committed by people with ample evidence and even with a video camera and they acquit or give sentencing such as giving an order in their house, possibly there is a fair judge but where is he?"
Who says that right now there are no sold judges?
"The popular vote is not good, there will be a lot of discontent and more violence in electoral rights, they must be people with experience but also with a lot of ethics"
"I LIKE THE REFORM, a change was already necessary in that sector. The current magistrates are very much in their social bubble. That position is supposed to be more of a social work and not a lucrative business. By the way, obviously not just any unprepared person will be elected; There is a specific profile for those positions, on the other hand, this gentleman made a very harsh criticism without emphasizing the advantages more thoroughly, which makes one think that the reform is very bad, but it is not like that, on the contrary it has quite a few advantages."
"This is how magistrates, senators and praetors were elected in republican Rome by plebiscites."
"Minute number three: 'currently the ministers are proposed by the president and ratified by the senate', is this not manipulation?"
What would be the most viable proposal to improve the Judiciary?
"I didn't think it was really a record, no if they give it forward to that proposal is super."
"He almost bought it with his word, of course what is trendy, he made me understand which side he is on"
"A new form of organized crime now with political support where my Mexico is going, all thanks to our politicians"
Surely the judges right now do not serve certain parties. Hahahaha everything he says against is how the outgoing judges work.
I agree that the corrupt system that exists in the judiciary should be changed
"The Judiciary has always responded to interests, that supposed autonomy does not exist and never will exist, except in theory, because in reality it is not like that, they respond to the interests of the ruling class. That the Judiciary is sought to respond to the interests of AMLO, of AMLO NO, of the 4T yes, The PJ has always responded to the governments in turn (right-wing neoliberals), but now they do not coincide with the new leadership, because they imply seeing the world in a way they do not know and attacking their own interests,  not of the judiciary, but of the class they became and represented for many, many years. Of everything AMLO has done, for me the reform of the PJ, if it is a historic watershed."
"I think that exactly all the reforms are necessary, I see all the proposals excellent because all lawyers become very corrupt with power and inefficiency is evident as well as seeking impartiality in justice? I don't know how much they pay the don but I think partial is not hehehe"
And that perhaps it was not like that the judges in the time of the prince are under the orders of the president
"So, the prosecutors (who do not integrate the investigation folders well) are also going to be elected by the people?"
"And for the presidents, if they are elected by the people who make them think, we cannot elect judges or favor, what suits them, we can choose everything and one is the one who commands"

"Excellent explanation, this helps to understand this topic clearly, congratulations!!"
REFORM IS GOING!! THAT'S WHY WE VOTE! OUTSIDE CORRUPT@S OF THE JUDICIARY!!
"I don't share their idea of being Venezuelan, that's what they've been saying for 6 years"
"It's okay so that it doesn't continue to happen, like the one who was sentenced to 40 years for collecting a batch, they accused her of extortion, that's injustice,"
"The court has never been independent, the parallel powers are the ones behind them"
"The judiciary itself agrees that reform is needed,.. But then? Why do they cry now that they have water up to their necks,. In addition, let's recognize that the judiciary is rotten to the core."
this guy has family in the judicial system... Corrupt Out of the Judiciary
"Why only the risks and not the advantages? The country needs reform, enough of mediocrity and corruption"
Corrupt out
"Levers, that's why they were fluffed up, because they are mainly looking to eliminate that"
"They want to take all the powers of the State. That's how Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Bolivia began. CARE.!"
But if before entering the judges already owe favors to the president with the simple fact that they were proposed by him.
"He says that in the previous stages they do not do the work, but they never exposed it, what gain the judiciary had with this situation, nor with all this professionalization career have they managed to clarify why they leave people and politicians free by the millions and without repairing the damage, and other poor suffer a sentence of years"
"It has never been autonomous, always, always subordinate to each other
What is said is already done, how much narco to
They have been released,
 
."
A judge accepted a bribe to dictate in favor of a friend's wife.. that it had no reason to exist. They are so corrupt that it is even scary to fall into their hands
No lifetime pension in favor with several points
"In the same way, we don't know our players, we don't know who they are or their careers."
"It is a disgusting amount of income that the people receive within the Magistrate, it is a shame and a disgrace that all those people are outraged and try not to reduce their budget, knowing that they are extravagant amounts... Why don't they talk about it anymore!!"
"But he mentions the texts of the reform, so that everyone can draw their own conclusions, not manipulate the information."
"And in reality, citizens are prepared in knowledge of laws, functions of the position to be performed, if they really have their professional ID, experience, ethics, etc? Would it be a danger and even more so if they ask citizens who do not even know how to read? To receive support they say that it is okay to change to reform"
"Mr. S. S. S. President and his successor, in Bolivia it was a disaster"
If we don't know them. We don't even know who they are
"Judges and magistrates should not be voted for if we already know from experience that deputies and senators are voted for and we have already seen that some arrive who do not have any studies or are of dubious reputation, imagine the lawyers who think of registering to participate, some good ones will arrive, others related to drug trafficking and others who by chance luck fell to them and the bolero knows more about law than they do"
"Judicial power.... Damn it.... Which power only God has power.... The laws of the judiciary are fine.... what is wrong is who put them there, no one elected them..... Out outside....."
This report is for those who defend the judiciary so that they do not go around making senseless marches
"It would be a change
Thus one would have the right to choose
And not only feeling helpless than not 
To be able to do nothing for injustice"
"Everything is very good but even so I think they should plan well what they are doing, such as putting recent graduates, they are the most influenceable, if now the narco is the one who puts and disposes I can imagine the mess that is going to be made. Just as an example, Sinaloa. They must analyze the pros and cons with a magnifying glass, not just go crazy."
"And what problems there were when Zedillo changed all the judges and magistrates, which"
"Judicial reform passed, prosecutors' offices continue"
"I think it's an extremely great idea, privileges are over by spending the people's money"
"It is an interesting reform, but there are interesting things that could go well but there are also proposals that can go very wrong, such as the election by popular vote and not by meritocracy, everything is very strange, I don't like that, everything else is fine and I only hope that they retract the vote of judges"
And how strange if this is how they defend those who have money
The older... more thieves besides what law do they apply if all those are sold out........ LONG LIVE AMLO
"And to him who gave him the tricks.
He who speaks of the road has walked."
"All are studied oeto not adu categories to the position k perform only to corrupt.   Cx that you don't want to leave. The positions k still have. But what k do not know k se. They are going to go to jail for corrupt people.   Van k X l.  They have time to run. Flee to abandon their positions.  ,"
For people km you the country is as it is there is no justice in the country do not be quiet no one else and you know it no there is justice do not deceive society
We have been behind for about 20 years.   As far as the law is concerned.    NI LOPEZ O.   NOT EVEN MRS. CLAUDIA WILL BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE CORRUPTION THAT ALREADY EXISTS.     MONEY RULES.  THE POOR ALWAYS LOSE. .
"Please do not confuse and do not explain the reform with interests of social level or power groups, what we cannot deny is that there is corruption in the judiciary."
"God bless me.  As president 

Listen, my lawyer, that says a lot about your profession, that you exercise the lack of professionalism, tenure in your career all the time in a country, will the person be appointed president? PRE- SI - DENTE NO NO PRESIDENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SHE IS A WOMAN OR A MAN OH MY Gooo"
"PLAN C, ALL SUPPORT TO OUR PRESIDENT, 
IT'S TIME TO PUT AN END TO THE S*** OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE PRIAN"
"The opinion of the end is superfluous, we need information if inclination is political"
Any change of current government will be for the good of the people because the current judges are already very fanged to get money and if you do not agree it is your problem
"Inform yourself sir, in the reform it is proposed that the current ones in function also parricipen.... HE JUST WANTS TO CONFUSE"
It reminds me of the scobby doo cartoons who is underneath this PRI character???
To centralize power
"In other words, it would be the same corruption, but more blatant nothing changes. "
It is a reform that is going to end our country.
The people are already bleeding... and to live off the people because they are not servants but living.
"I am surprised that no one has said that this is very much from the old government of the PRI, this is basically allowing more corruption by arbitrarily moving and accusing those in charge, this only benefits the president in office"
They seek that justice be partial
"On the plus side of those changes it would be great, but on the downside, as he explains, the risks are big"
Only gasoline should go up
"it was going well but it comes out with the magic word, Venezuela But thank you for your video I am watching many where people of different ideologies speak."
Risks and what is happening now are not risks
"Of course, for us who are not politicians or lawyers, that is how it is understood, but it would be that we were granted the complete reform in PDF, and returning to the most classic case in this type of reform, Pontius Pilate, that the people, without arguments, asked for the cross, indication of Jesus, but it was what the people wanted and that is not justice."
Hahahaha that's laughable !!!
"A question to all parties on the subject, is there really justice in Mexico?  If so, they could explain why there is so much crime without prosecution, treason is really punished?... The truth is that our country is infested with loopholes and/or legal loopholes strategically manufactured to commit misdeeds by the supposed patriots of this country"
I think some things are good because it's been many years and there were no changes there
"And little now, the judiciary is autonomous?"
"Because once and for all we do not submit to a popular vote who is promoted to general or colonel etc... let's see what the military thinks, that they all take away their rank and that the good and wise people vote for who wins each rank..."
The magistrates already belong to power groups... what's the difference?????
"Mayors, deputies, senators, are popularly elected and in the end they only see their own interests, forgetting the people."
"IT WILL DEFINITELY NO LONGER BE AUTONOMOUS, IT WILL BE THE SAME AS THE INE"
"Many people in their ignorance only judge because they say before we were worse, but never before has our freedom and life been so attacked... A reform of the judiciary cannot be accepted if the president will have the power to choose due to pressure from support or threats. We should analyze the situation well before talking about the issue, let's not be crying like Venezuela that President Maduro has controlled the 3 powers and there is no way to get him out..."
The people put the people away
"The judicial system in Mexico has not been independent of the executive branch, the interests of the party in power have been managed and that is how dominance existed for decades in Mexico. It is a very complex issue and the innovations remain to be seen."
"In any case, there will be tricks and ways to corrupt them or to be corrupted, there is always a way to do tricks unfortunately "
"Hahaha no mamms, that already happens with judges, they already serve the interests of some..."
"PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES, PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES, PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES"
"For if they were manipulated to choose them?  Well, before they put those who they wanted, we didn't even know who they were, at least now we will know a little who they are"
"Even the international community realizes the negative effects that this reform implies, but the 35 million Mexicans who voted for the ""4T"" who do not have a p.. idea of what is happening in his own country."
"They are afraid that the president has massive control and they do not realize that for many years they have passed laws, when the people have always been against it, for bribery."
"All the support for AMLO, the judiciary in Mexico is corrupt as it is possible that they have better salaries than judges and magistrates in the United States. I lived in the USA and I have my dual nationality and I can tell you that in the United States when there are elections people vote for the judges so why not in Mexico? What a father, then, I put myself and re-elect myself again."
"Well, if those who according to the labor law protect us in the pandemic disappeared the lawsuits and I was left with nothing"
"Excellent, but I would like to know if it is correct to say ""the president"" or ""the president"". Hopefully you can clear up this doubt"
They want more money for the games and trucks provided
"Journalists or communicators must be impartial, and now I see that all of them make comments inclined to one side or the other"
"Imagine that a feminist leader is a candidate, what a horror"
I went in more explains everything I smelled well in favor of the people excellent.no matter how much I want to dirty it
"And not the crime, they don't pay the judges anymore"
"Friend, even if it hurts you, the reform was approved, hopefully and really is the solution to so much corruption that there is in the country because you can't deny that the ay in the country don't give so much good to the issue because the people are put to sleep with so many words you can't cover the sun with a finger na avia justice before or oy no more"
But currently there is the public defender's office
"You, not my comrade Mr. Attorney or do not give what profession you practice, 
 the truth is that I didn't even publish your type of videos look let me comment something and let me comment something in general to all the YouTube colleagues and who see this type of videos and Mexicans like me there is a phrase very mentioned in life that says: ? ALL CHANGE
 (NO MATTER HOW BAD IT WAS)   IT'S GOOD SO WITH THAT I TELL YOU ALL YOU PUBLISHER OF THAT VIDEO,    
 And it is better to stop publishing so much dirt to the new reform and iron!! The reform was approved "
Magical Thinking Reform for Magical Thinking The world is full of good intentions
" He speaks as if the judiciary is now working well, and that judges and ministers have nothing to do with drug traffickers and some white-collar criminals, please; who they want to fool."
"BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THEY WEAR DISGUISES, FOR THEIR BENEFIT. . DOES THE HEALTH SYSTEM SAY THAT IT IS BETTER THAN DENMARK'S?"
"Ha, ha, ha, ha says that the judiciary is now independent "
"It would have transformed the law by giving the death penalty to murderers, rapists, kidnappers, narcos, and anyone who violates the law and corrupts the good customs and respect that every Mexican deserves! And he is not there alone raising the chicken coop, making people fight, and making more division "
He says they could be affiliated with a party and proceed in favor of one of them or some member of the underworld as if they were not now for God's sake.
"In reality there has never been
 Division of powers"
"We must give our opinion through cerebral judgment, not viceral, until today, none of the rigged forecasts of the pseudo-specialists, have worked for them, and how good."
What is currently perfect?
"With all due respect,,, 
In case anyone feels, let them insult them in some paragraph,,,,,
But we all have different angles of seeing mistakes and seeing problems,
Here's how this works,,,
Personally, I think that I still don't understand, that there were prepared people, and according to the best politicians, 
According to the best television stations, the best reporters, the best policemen, and the best jobs and the best salaries, according to the best representatives of the nation,
According to what we had a political eminence, yes, but it was in their favor,,,
I repeat: but what I still don't understand is, that if we had many people who said they were the best and according to the most intelligent, then how is it that they did not see, or detect all the benefits and supports, in favor of the people,
So why did they oppose the projects of the nation, if those projects were  
For the good of the people,
To generate, 
That they did not see, or detected that to begin with, our old people were not left helpless,,?
They also delayed many people, with their newscasts, they said one thing and it was another,
They deceived us vilely,
And they were all connected,
That's the worst,
Many so correct and legal, that we were,  
We made all the payments, holdings, property taxes, and taxes until we couldn't,
Because if we evaded a payment, 
The rest you already know,
And they are such rats, traitors, and corrupt,
And then crying,,,
Greetings Mexico awake,,,,"
"I see everything as perfect, maybe only that of not having experience in their position, but if they vote they will have to be well informed to vote, but taking away lifetime pensions of enormous salaries is great, that they spend it is the bad thing but I see the reform well"
"I'm so scared of these new reforms.. it doesn't sound good, God help us."
"Your analysis is against reform.
You should also analyze how rotten the judiciary currently is. That really the sabadazos are loose the white-collar criminals and that they use the law in favor of the potentates$"
The people have more power
"Mr. Emilio and Comunicreativos good day, thank you for keeping us informed. Following our Box Cut and watching the video of Purple Folder, the president in turn is a threat to families with SO MANY LIES"
Criminals do not require judicial reform to buy judges and magistrates. It has been doing it and they will continue to do it.
#ElCartelDeLaToga
"There's no way you can invest without a guide. So, I wonder: what's the best approach?"
I just know that there is too much corruption in Mexico and so it is difficult to know if it is a good thing or a bad thing
"History has shown us that the more decentralized power is, the fewer abuses there are. What worries me is that Mexico usually has a hard time knowing how to choose its representatives"
Doctors with specialties save lives and do not earn those salaries or have those pensions
"If they WANT to get rich, ""because they studied at Harvard, at Princeton"" LET THEM GO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR !!!!"
"Be careful, the fact that a public servant earns more is not a guarantee of higher quality. Moreover, today judges are not chosen for their excellence but for nepotism.  Good analysis Luis, in six months we will see how successful you were."
"Well, finally something neutral and concise! It is an excellent summary, with the information only for everyone to draw their conclusions. Thanks a lot!"
"1. Here we are not in the European Royalty so that they spend on luxuries, they are public servants who are very well enough even if they reduce their salary.
2. If you want to be a millionaire, you make a mistake by going to work in the government.
Doctors who want to make money only do private medicine but there are those who like to work in public institutions, that does not mean they are better or worse if you have a Vocation and Love for your Profession."
125 thousand a month is not enough for you? Imagine how the millions of Mexicans who earn 12 thousand or less survive
"How little memory those who are over 40 years old have and for young people I tell them that you have to know the history. The laws in Mexico, for the most part, have been modified for the benefit of a few and the people have been left to their fate. It is true that in this last six-year term there have been mistakes and very corrupt people who slipped in from the other parties and now continue to do their thing, but I have also seen that a little more attention has been paid to the people. Hopefully the judicial reform will be for the good and they will stop protecting both organized crime and white-collar criminals no matter who they are. Hopefully."
What was clear to me is the lack of mother that all public employees have who look only for their interests and that's !!
"Honestly, it seems to me that some investors may be genuinely concerned that the status quo of legality no longer exists as they already knew about Mexico, that is, many invested in Mexico with confidence, yes, but that they could pass laws and regulations through the arch of triumph and do very good business with a little investment in the corruption that lubricated their profits,  Of course they are nervous! Of course they are hesitating! Well, how could it not? if there is a possibility that the law will now be executed..."
"Remember that it is a public service. Not to become a millionaire. In any case, look for another job."
"If this is the path politicians want to take, I would also suggest that they add the following rules to avoid concerns about politicizing judicial elections: 

1. The reform could ban endorsements of political parties, limit campaign financing to small donations or public funds, and ban traditional political advertising. 

2. The independent team they plan to create should also oversee the campaigns. Creating a nonpartisan judicial election commission to oversee campaigns could ensure that candidates focus on legal qualifications rather than political agendas. 

3. Judges would have to pass a merit-based review before applying. 

4. Voters could also use evaluations of judicial performance to review judges' careers.

5. Could you also implement retention elections? This strategy could replace competitive campaigns, allowing the public to vote on the performance of judges without traditional campaign tactics.

These things *could* preserve judicial independence while promoting accountability.

Honestly, I don't understand all the details of this reform, but I think that these measures should at least be present"
"Thanks for the sensible explanation, neutral experts like you are very much needed, greetings!!"
The divided country and the narcos getting stronger and stronger nmmen
"Woooow!! I had tried to look for more information about this reform and I had not found someone who explained it in such a clear way, thank you very much."
Excellent explanation!
"Ministers have 12 years to make retirement plans... In addition to those they have been able to collect since the beginning of their working life, I don't see a problem in that sense because in any case they will earn much more than any other ordinary Mexican... And I also think it will be a change in which only with the passage of time we will see if it was good or bad... Now everything is scrambled but it will have to calm down... Like everything in life... My opinion... Greetings Luismi"
"Luis Mi, currently the Judges and Magistrates are not defined by shortlist but by meritocracy through competitive examinations, it is an excellent channel and helps many people including me, however there is no need to misinform because there is a constant struggle to deny the farces that are said about the Judicial Branch of the Federation"
This explanation with neutral intentions is appreciated.
"Autonomy for indigenous peoples is very good, and protecting water and natural resources is also"
"There is only one soup here. Mexicans want stability, we don't have money to survive a crisis. We are not politicians, we are people who live from day to day. We are not self-sufficient, we consume many products from abroad, we have just come out of a pandemic, refurbishing at the moment seems more whim than anything else. We are tied to investors because we are not so entrepreneurial, if these friends start leaving because of the uncertainty, what will happen to the employees. We don't have savings because there is no growth in this country, the economy is not good, it's not right for a party to be in total power, we've already gone through that, young people don't know what the times of the PRI were like. In short, if this is not remedied, we will live the consequences and those most affected, you know who they will be. Here the government or the businessmen do not suffer, the worker suffers. There are orders for them."
"Good explanation of the reform, the truth is that I have already seen about 20 videos and in none of them do they explain it in this way thanks for the info"
"The real problem is not democracy itself, but with judges and their election. In fact, I would dare to say that this is even irrelevant. The real problem is whether or not the judges are going to be affiliated with a political party. The function of a judge is to analyze the law in a neutral way, The problem is that if the judge has a party behind him, then he will have an ideology behind him. Therefore it will no longer be neutral and any judgment it makes for or against a harsh law will be influenced by that ideology and not by an objective judgment. 

And I understand that judges usually also have ideologies behind them, true, but this system that proposes judicial reform promotes that judges advocate their ideology rather than their neutrality before the law. As a logical consequence. That is the real problem with this reform and it is the real risk."
"Every time a judge determines against my fundamental rights, I file my complaints and they do not proceed because today they are in a hurry. I hope that with the Reform they will determine honestly."
Thank you for clarifying the situation
"And what a doctor who is on duty is not a little to you, or a military or policeman who is still on guard duty and risks his life??? Work is done by vocation and by love because if you don't like your work what they pay you will NOT be enough and the example is in the previous presidents of Mexico that not even millions and millions were enough for them"
"Whoever is paid a little 130,000 pesos, let him go to the private sector, the public sector is to serve the people, to have a vocation for service, not to serve oneself."
"Very clear and objective, thank you very much for explaining it for those of us who do not understand this subject. A serious source of information!"
"Thank you for keeping us informed of such current and delicate issues for Mexico. What I have seen is the indifference that many people have, either because they are fed up with politicians, or ignorance of the issues of the future of the country. I would like you to comment in your next videos on how we are going to live (or survive) with the crisis and uncertainty that we will have with all these reforms. Thank you again."
"Not all magistrates and judges studied at Harvard and, why do the people have to recover their investment in education? If they had the means to afford that education, I congratulate them but we do not have to pay with our taxes for their recovery. In addition...

I would trust more in a law school specializing in the Mexican constitution and in a judge whose alma mater is in Mexico. I wouldn't trust a junior malinchista so much; not being an ordinary citizen. Maybe if I were a businessman like Salinas Pliego it would be different, but I'm not. 

And from there I contradict you; No, the people not only need a judge who knows a lot and that's it, they also need a judge willing to do justice beyond their personal benefit"
"Thanks for the explanation. It was very clear!! And indeed we have to wait and give a vote of faith, based on facts that have shown that the balance of the economy in Mexico is balancing out."
"It seems to me that they had already clarified that they must comply with Thursdays and Magistrates with a profile of knowledge and experience. It is the first filter. Then some will be selected and those selected will be voted. 

As for the salary, I think they do it so that those who want to participate do so by vocation and not necessarily by cost-benefit. Just like a president. A position in which you are at the service of the nation and not the nation at the service of your enrichment.
It would not hurt to evaluate how much it costs to educate a person for that level and establish a minimum salary in that sense, growing as inflation"
"3:30 It's not about taking advantage of what they studied, it's that for those who want to be in that position it's because they want to SERVE THEIR COUNTRY."
Thank you very much for the summary Don Luis
"Thank you for this time being so objective in your contribution, if I am concerned about the reform since society is very influenceable for years actors and actresses, soccer players, boxers have been in political positions and they have shone for their incompetence in reality in my opinion they are figures put there to keep the masses calm with familiar faces that influence people emotionally,  But I trust that a very strong current of informed Mexicans is also growing, of Mexicans who are no longer left behind, of Mexicans increasingly focused on what we are, a powerful nation and that with discipline and organization we can improve every day!"
"Mexico needs to be a new country in its reforms, because previous reforms have been a national failure.
Empowering the people is what I understand they are trying to do with these reforms.
How to solve ? at first it will be difficult for us to adapt it to the new lifestyle in Mexico, but with the passage of time we will perfect this model."
That's why I follow Luis my business !!! From Córdoba Veracruz
"Will we vote between the Sergios Mayer, Cuauhtémocs Blancos and capos that Morena imposes!!?? God"
"To all those who comment ""why didn't they start with the labor reform of the 40 hours?"", ""And the prosecutors's offices?"", ""The judiciary is going to become partisan and/or politicized"", let me tell you that:

1. The current judiciary (including the supreme court, district judges, among others) have stopped multiple reforms proposed by this government, which guaranteed that the reform of the 40 hrs, as well as an eventual reform of the prosecutors' offices and public ministries were not going to be reversed as well, that is why a reform of a power that has stopped multiple constitutional reforms was necessary,  so that now, prosecutors' offices, ministries, etc., can be reformed, since (and there goes the next point)...

2. The current judiciary is already politicized (not in its entirety), but nepotism, subordination, corruption, omission and even open support or rejection of the current government and other political actors, such as the PRI, but especially the PAN, which has been shown to have a direct relationship with the law school of several educational institutions, has been demonstrated.  So yes, the reform may not end these vices, but at least now we will know exactly who leans more to one side or the other, since in theory we will know more about our judges, magistrates and ministers.

In conclusion, the reform can be perfected (improvable) and on paper (because it is not yet in operation) there are things that can be positive and others negative, things that can be corrected or adjusted with the secondary laws, but the important thing is that the first step had to be taken, I repeat, it was necessary to start with the judiciary because it has limited,  mostly unjustifiably, reforms that will help in the transformation of this country, I have heard phrases like, ""a reform yes, but not like this"" and I wondered, well, why until now?, if a judicial reform was really ""urgent"", because at no time was it proposed by law schools, bar associations or by the judiciary itself,  Anyway, excuse the will, but it was necessary to share my point of view."
We must remember all the grievances that have been caused by the judiciary but at the same time the great benefits that many companies and power groups have had with a judicial power as a mode. Obviously it causes fear for those companies that could get away with it or not pay taxes for those vicinity and benefits of the judiciary.
"I've learned a lot from professional financial channels like this one. That is why I send a greeting and thanks for the effort and the work dedicated.
I think that if a judge thinks ""it's not going to be enough for me to live in luxury, I'll do crooked business"" it's corrupt to defend the current system from that unintelligent logic.
If the national or international financial system and power hits and hinders the Mexican economy, and out of ""fear"" of it the democratization of justice is not promoted, it would be a real vulnerability to external influence, and even vulnerability of our sovereignty. 
On the other hand, since 1929 a single party has controlled all the powers in Mexico, making the 1917 Constitution undoing at will, modifying it unilaterally and only today they worry about the one-party system? Waters with fallacious speeches. Best regards."
Thanks for the information
"What independence of judges and magistrates?
The alliances with parties under the water have already been proven. People of money and so on.
It is in the interest of the United States that it does not change, so they pressure Mexico with its immense rate of impunity to what is to blame for the crime in the United States. The U.S. pressures extraditions, citing Mexico's poor justice system.

Economic speculation is promoted by the United States to resist and stop reform."
"Earning around 125 thousand pesos plus benefits is not enough for that type of position, I believe that there are people equally or more prepared who do not earn even half of that and who would gladly accept a position like this. The fourteenth economy in the world is not represented at all in the majority of the population, it cannot be that whatever you do does not reach you for the basic basket, health or acquire a patrimony. Even if they earn 1 million a month does not guarantee that they will be handled with integrity, ethics and dignity. Why the head of the executive and legislative branches if they are elected by vote?"
"Thank you for your information, and if you are right about many things"
"If it were for the money to the magistrates we would have the best judicial systems and it is not like that, on the contrary it is better that those who are by vocation with so much money live outside the reality of the country, on the other hand there are many researchers with international postgraduate degrees subject to more reviews and filters who do not earn 100 thousand and live with dignity. Also if you don't have the vocation it is not bad to make more money on the other hand. From my point of view, it would be good to raise the salary of the lowest level workers associated with the judiciary and also to hire more personnel and to handle more efficiently in the resolutions and number of cases, where we are very behind."
"I totally agree with the Reform. I'm a professional and I'm not doing badly. It is a lie that only people without education support this. It doesn't take much science to realize that these judges are not on our side, nor on the side of the working class, nor of the entrepreneurs, nor even of the businessmen who prefer to deal with fair rules rather than with a bureaucratic and corrupt state. These judges, in general, look after their own interests, no matter who they harm. They are bad people and this must change. I applaud your stance, as you are critical but objective. Good for you."
!!!!! HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED
Either the people elect him with the new reform or he is elected by the compadre with the old system.
"If they know the salary in advance, if it is little, they do not enter and the problem is over, it has been shown that those who say they have advanced studies are the worst..."
"alas! It can't be that you make videos with incomplete information, what a value!"
"Seriously, no one thinks that inflation and that there is a risk of losing foreign ""investments"" 
Is it merely CONTROL?! 

Because Mexico alone can sustain itself! It has the capacity to generate raw materials and products for export!

But there is more than one country that wants control of ours, so the last thing they want is for there to be changes that can generate conflicts for them and not allow them to continue MANEUVERING AT WILL.

And it is more than proven when more and more foreign companies are settling in Mexico.

Call them Waltmart with Bodega Aurrera, Circle k (formerly extra) were bought by a Brazilian company, the 3B stores are Colombian, as well as Canada took over several, if not all, mines in our country.

And surely there are many more! But, we can only wait, and understanding that these changes are to prevent corruption from continuing, that those involved complicate it and try to find nooks and crannies to get their way, is another thing.

There are more bad guys (and sellouts) who are sitting in power right now, and this is not going to end if people don't participate."
"In the end, corruption will end up winning as it has always been and is currently. It will bring more problems than benefits "
Thank you for your explanation
"In my view, it seems to me that if the judges and magistrates do not accommodate their salary, they can take advantage of it there at Harward where they studied."
"At the end of the day, the country's money is with the politicians, senators, deputies, magistrates; their salaries are very high and the truth is that very few work their position correctly for the benefit of the people. A modest salary is fine, so that how much they earn in what they really do makes them sin in greed, especially politicians, while citizens have a very poor salary and despite that many barely live their day to day; that makes them believe that even the president should earn more? Simply that more money incites more money. Power today more than ever will not belong to the people, which is what they make ""believe"", since most humble people are influenceable; and power in the hands of a government, will overlook everything, including the Constitution itself... In short, it is up to one to continue doing one's part as a citizen and lead a life as correct as possible; without harming third parties. God bless Mexico that will need him today more than ever and the whole world, end times are approaching and hope is definitely nothing more than faith and love for God, to be good people and expect the best from him."
"Very good analysis, concrete and punctual"
"If the Insabi and the IMSS welfare did not work, what makes them think that this nonsense is going to work? It's going to be a disaster...."
"The important one was not the judicial reform, but the electricity reform that the judges have always overturned, we are buying electricity abroad instead of generating it totally here, I think that would benefit us more. According to what I read, we are taking more than 200 billion per year out of the country just by paying for electricity and foreign companies are not investing in wiring or infrastructure."
"Excellent video, I like to see analysis, discussions, different points of view. 

I believe that the point is not to enrich yourself as President, Judge, Magistrate or Minister, the point is to provide a service to your country, your community, your family, to the people you would like to see prosper. It is good that judges with studies and investments in certifications, courses, postgraduate degrees want to be remunerated, but if they seek public positions to achieve it, I think that we are failing there, there has to be a balance. You are not going to help a cause with your knowledge (doctors, engineers, lawyers) just for the simple fact of being well paid, or it should not be the case, I think it is a deficiency of capitalism as an aspirational model, it impacts a little on social or community responsibility that makes us all grow as a person, and gives us a value that money cannot give us.

But I do agree that this reform is the first that is being carried out in this cycle and I did not like the haste with which they are carrying it out. The chambers of deputies and senators are to propose and analyze points of view from the perspective of all Mexicans, and I think I have only seen discussions in the same direction, without debate, without exchange of ideas, without refutations, just for the simple fact of thinking ""we are from the same team"" or ""you are against it"", but I think that not everyone represents the same thing or the same people."
"The salary is the least important thing when it is assumed that those positions as well as the politicians are there for the love of Mexico, and not for the money."
"I stopped the video after 20 seconds and said to myself:
Most likely, in summary, I would say that the market is pending, as every time a legal modification is applied, first it is analyzed in the markets and the investment therefore goes down, affecting investments and other economic applicants, but later it will level out or position itself in one way or another, it is too early to deduce what will happen in the coming years.
In general, the economy has always been unstable because ironically it is a coin in the air, which is tossed every day and its outcome is always uncertain.
In my personal opinion, without being an economic analyst or something similar, it is saving, investing and producing, no matter how minimal the profit is, it is profit.
And on the other hand, spend on what is necessary, the basics and have created a fund for the so-called unforeseen expenses.
Greetings and I continue watching the video because it never hurts to learn."
"Thank you Luismi, very good explanation and totally objective your information."
"When Zedillo became President, he removed all the judges from the judiciary and put in those he wanted. This change made it without asking anyone and much less there was a popular vote... he practically did it in dictatorial style. 
But no one said anything, the television media applauded and everyone calm.
But now the media is crying because the People have voted for this change."
It is difficult to support the salary of a judge in a country that is the minimum wage is 250 pesos a day while they earn 6666 pesos a day approx according to their base salary and obviously millions in benefits and Christmas bonus. Serving the people has nothing to do with living like kings
Excellent talk. Thank you Luis. I understood the reform better. And let's hope it works 
"I CONGRATULATE YOU LUISMI, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE COHERENT AND CONCISE. HOW WONDERFUL TO MEET SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T REDOUND ALL THE TIME, YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE MORE FOLLOWER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUIDANCE"
"I worry that the ""could politicize the judicial system"" is more likely to be ""politicize the judicial system"", all the background we have tells us that it will."
In memory of Marisela Escobedo!! A better reform for the victims of violence!!
"It would be great if you could answer three things. Do you think that today judges are not popularly elected?,, Well, yes, only those who are most popular in the business leadership are the ones who are elected. Do you think that nowadays drug trafficking is not filtered in the judges? Anyone who affirms this is closing their eyes. Well, we all know how they have freed money from criminals and the criminals themselves have been pardoned or have been granted protections. This is the problem that many pseudo-informed people have. They are informed in the media that they are only coup plotters and are only protecting Power and the money of the rich"
Luismi.. The ministers of the SCJN are the only ones who are chosen by shortlists... judges and magistrates reach these positions through competitive examinations.
"Here the delicate thing with the argument of foreign investment is the limit of a country's sovereignty and the exploitation of resources at low cost.  that in past six-year terms foreign investment has come, but the economic spillover is not proportional. Just take a look at the poverty belts. in Puerto Vallarta, Cancun etc. People live with a salary that is barely enough to eat, with a quality of life, where both parents have to work, abandoning their children and who are employed by large international or national corporations as well. . Clearly this, which is not only the fault of a few politicians, but of a worldwide system is reaching its last days."
"It worries me and I don't agree. THE AGENDA OF THE SAO PAULO 2030 FORUM ADVANCES.
NEVER HAND OVER ALL POWER TO ONE PERSON OR ONE PARTY."
"And by the time they are going to come to pave my street, that man has already come and gone and did not comply."
"I congratulate you Luis because you gave a very balanced explanation about the reform, which should be taken as a grain of salt. I especially congratulate you because I know that your position on it in general is not favorable but you managed to give a very interesting explanation about it"
"My shares in the Mexican stock exchange are falling silent and have affected my investments!!
And I think it could be because of this situation, I don't know if it's just Me!!"
"I think that all change is good, we live in a corrupt and unpunished state, I hope it works"
It's good that things are being done as the people ask for
Informed Mexicans will never be defeated
"The reform of the judiciary in my country is necessary, there are ministers who have more than 40 families working in the offices of the judiciary and other institutions, there are some who earn more than 400 thousand pesos a month thanks to diversions of public funds that they themselves authorize, there is a minister whose two daughters appear on the payroll of the PDJ and earns more than 100 thousand pesos a month,  They live off the public radio that millions of Mexicans pay for and surprise they only showed up once to work. The judiciary in Mexico is almost a monopoly controlled by cronies, sponsored persons and relatives as well as one of the most corrupt in Latin America, there are people who have not been prosecuted that lead to more than 90% of unsolved cases, people who for more cases of corruption, tax evasion, etc. have been acquitted,  people whose bank accounts are unfrozen, among other evils, given that justice is in charge of those who have the most regardless of the crimes they have. 
A reform of the Judiciary in Mexico is more than necessary and fair, in order to gradually access a rule of law, in which every citizen has the right to be and feel represented before the law regardless of their socioeconomic indolence."
"I am Mexican and I know well what the federal justice system is in Mexico. Unfortunately the federal judiciary is managed by 65 families including ministers, magistrates, and judges and the federal judiciary is at the service of the wealthiest, and if you don't believe, RICARDO SALINAS PLIEGO owes the treasury more than twenty-five million pesos in taxes to the federation.  But since the Federal Judiciary granted him a federal injunction not to pay, then this gentleman says that he is not going to pay."
"It is wrong that it does not affect the local judicial powers, because when the reform is implemented, they will have to adapt to the federal model"
"Error in 2:50, he does not propose that they have a lower salary than the president, that is already in the Constitution. The judges pass that through the arch of triumph. What is intended is that what is already there is made effective."
"That sound in the background does not allow us to hear, it is horrifying."
"Other key points are that the Judiciary has been politicized for decades, 60% of the workers are family members or acquaintances and with such a high percentage of nepotism, is there really a judicial career? Many there have salaries that not even the CEO of a company gets to have and the reform was proposed since February and to date the opposition has not proposed anything."
Privileges are over! Long live Mexico ??
"If justice is already politicized anyway, ask yourself who puts the judges there... according to what they can do for them"
"they earn 25 thousand dollars a month and for 30 years they had blocked the increase in the minimum wage by 80 pesos, 4 dollars a day, 120 dollars a month, the lowest in Latin America"
"Those who support the politicization of justice do so because they believe that it will favor them, then when the political current changes they end up learning the hard way."
"And they put the corrupt Marko Cortés in their video, whom not even in his party they want."
"It's good what Mexico does, congratulations Mexicans are an example of the world"
"And it was called Democracy, Greetings from Venezuela ??"
"There is a lot of money that many corrupt people steal, let's hope that some of that changes with this."
"Justice has always had a party, but they hid it, now we will know to which party they belong, the exam for federal judges was a formality because they were always appointed by hand."
ONLY THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN MEXICO FOREVER KNOW HOW NECESSARY THIS REFORM WAS??
"But that would basically lead to the judiciary being controlled by the ruling party, it is never, ever a good idea to allow the concentration of power. The separation of powers exists so that they can counterbalance and monitor each other."
"The perfect dictatorship never left, it evolved."
"For decades there is no justice, drastic changes are needed"
"If one thing is clear, it is that history teaches us that man does not learn anything from it. It seems that societies need to hit rock bottom to finish learning from their mistakes; sometimes at a very high price. This reform is one of those crossroads where, depending on the route taken, they can lead us to a great disaster. That changes need to be made? Of course, yes, a reform is required, surely, but what is the regulatory body? Who evaluates the competencies and capacities of these magistrates? Of those who are going to impart justice? Only with a popular election? Are the people prepared and sufficiently informed to discern who to elect as magistrates ?? On the other hand, it is the risk that a political tendency; Whatever it may be, it can monopolize control of the Supreme Court; see the case of what is happening today in Venezuela ?? For at least 20 years since the application of what is now called ""reform of the judiciary"" this is a Pandora's box from which we do not know what may come out of it. Undoubtedly, changes must be made after what Mexican history has taught us over time, but for a fair and impartial reform a national consultation with all the sectors involved is necessary since it is in the public interest and concerns us all for the defense of democracy. God bless and protect Mexico ??"
"As you say, it seems beneficial for Mexico, what you are not saying is that Morena has manipulated the votes, that they have so many key people on the payroll, current magistrates, among others. What MLO is doing is ensuring that it can change Mexico's Constitution at will. In order for such important bodies to be submitted to a popular vote, they first have to guarantee that whoever counts the votes and regulates the vote is an independent and impartial entity, and currently belongs to the Morena payroll."
"How many of you have any idea what the name of the deputy you voted for is? Exactly. They voted for the logo. REFORM IS URGENT, but not this. Bolivia and us, REALLY? I feel sorry for the poor who will not be able to contribute to judges' campaigns."
"I am Mexican and this reform was the straw that broke the camel's back for me to see the possibility of emigrating to another country in a few years. Even though I am young and without a university degree, I consider myself a very well-informed person, since the vast majority of my family works in the public sector and we have seen with our own eyes that since AMLO came to power he began to enact a series of laws and reforms that violated the constitution, there is more poverty now than in previous six-year terms.

And now with this reform of the judicial system we are closer to ending up like countries like Venezuela and Cuba, the people outside politics who are in favor of this reform do not take into account the corruption that exists in the prosecutors' offices and public ministries, as well as the corruption of the president, his family, friends and members and allies of his party who do not stop clinging to political power.

However, after all when I leave Mexico, I will miss the culture, food, beautiful beaches and climate of many regions of my country very much."
Very superficial his report!
"Gimme tha power, it is basic to know why powers are divided and now they have concentrated them in the executive, that has a name."
"I didn't like the background music.
You are not heard well."
Lady as a legacy. It has left destruction. Violence and more misery.
"time will tell if this is a good or bad or decision, what I do not think is that the evaluation to which the candidates for judges were subjected is eliminated... Moreover, these evaluations should be prior for all candidates, so that only qualified people will be in positions of power, and not incompetent politicians who have no idea what they should do in their positions or do not even have a decent level of education"
And the ministers of the MP for when? You are going to ask for justice and after 7 years they open a file
"They accept that reform is necessary but not like that, they had years to propose the reform that they consider necessary and they did not do it. They say that with this reform the judiciary will be at the service of the party in government when we all know that this has always been the case, the president and the legislators of the PRI and the PAN put their judges when they were in the majority. They say that MORENA uses its majority to ""impose"" its reforms when they have always done it that way; If the majorities support you it is so that you decide the path that the country should follow, the neoliberals did it for decades until the majority of the people said enough, that is democracy."
"If they already vote badly for their deputies and presidents, what makes them think that they will be able to vote judges responsibly?"
"Our government has no idea how much people are suffering these days. I feel sorry for disabled people who don't get the help they deserve. Thank you Petra Roberts, imagine investing $1000 and receiving $4000 in 3 days."
I explain them in a very simple way to those who are not from Mexico: What the party in power (morena) wants is to have control of the three powers and get rid of ALL the checks and balances in order to perpetuate itself in power as the PRI (another party in Mexico) did for 70 years.
"36 MILLION MEXICANS VOTE FOR THE REFORM 
LONG LIVE PLAN C "
"You forgot to mention that the US opposes the reform arguing that voting for magistrates is undemocratic in Mexico because it has judges as a mode, when in their case they vote for their judges as will now be done in Mexico. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that judges release those prosecuted by law at the request of the executive, judges in accordance with their interests, even to the detriment of the population."
"Corruption, impunity, nepotism, abuses and contempt for the constitution have flooded the PJF, yes to the reform! "
"We voted for that, we want reforms!"
"Step #1 approval at the federal level being able to provide improvements in secondary laws, step #2 reform state prosecutors' offices"
"Respectfully, VERY VERY VERY superficial your capsule.... Laura."
Also that they reform Congress and remove Los Pluris and do not allow there to be sloppy or sellouts.
And also that the newscasts that misreport be punished.
"In other words, you are not going to vote and elect a faceless judge, of the judges elected and already known, one would be the faceless judge in cases of organized crime, you will not know who it was, so it would be logical."
"Don't be clumsy, boy, faceless judges will not be elected, citizens will elect judges with faces, but criminals will not know who is judging them when they are prosecuted"
Why don't they reduce the Guebones of DEPUTIES WITH NEW COMPUTERS AND CELL PHONES FOR NOTHING MORE TO GO TO SLEEP OR CHAT OR NOT GO 500 MAINTAINED FROM 100 THOUSAND PESOS ONWARDS
"How BRUTE, BRUTE..... Put zero on it... Even a child understands faceless judges."
"Incredible that person who is explaining (misinforming), if he is going to say things he should say them well."
What absurd comparisons. The faceless judge has nothing to do with knowing the judges for whom they are voted.
"I like your strategy to communicate, but in terms of what is happening politically in the country and especially your explanation of how the votes to elect ministers and judges will be, with all due respect you should find out more and better, do you think that those who are now are showered with wisdom?
There is a lot of corruption and if one day you need the service, I wish you to get an Honorable Judge who is not CORRUPT.
WE ARE IN A TRANSFORMATION
THAT THE MEXICAN PEOPLE ENDORSE AND HOPE THAT IT IS FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL, NOT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST"
"Typical of corrupt governments, those that ""the sovereignty of the country"" that ""international interference"" that ""do not stick their noses"" ah, but when they need support of any kind then they do remember that if the international community exists, international law."
"Don't confuse your audience, people are going to vote for judges and magistrates and once elected, the one who judges drug traffickers are the ones who will have no face, you are already like Chumel"
"I do not feel that modifying the popular vote will end corruption, there must be the most prepared people, with experience, the polular does not mean that it is the best and if it does not work you remove it."
"Now yes, as moms say, ARE YOU OR DO YOU?  You know very well what they mean by faceless judges."
The president explains that El Pueblo is going to elect the judges. But he does not explain that it will not be by direct election but through the senators. Because they deduce that senators are representatives of the people. So if Morena has more senators
"I don't understand how anyone can believe that we are going to do better if it is not their knowledge but their popularity that puts the judges in their position.
In other words, a judge who proved to have more knowledge than 15 other people is somehow worse than someone who only had to prove that he or she had completed a law degree.
Not only that, that judge should have proven his knowledge after having held lower positions, after a judicial career, HAVING EXPERIENCE.
That they review one by one the sentences of each judge and make it clean, perfect, but a system must be improved not destroyed, we are talking about positions that imply KNOWLEDGE and 95% of the population does not know the basic culture of Law to elect a judge or magistrate.
By electing deputies by vote, see the wonder of imb3cil people who arrive, I don't want to imagine what barbarities await with elected judges based on their charisma and the sponsorship of some political godfather. ???"
"It is an exceptional judicial reform, it benefits Mexico, there will be true justice, which our country needs very much"
"Congratulations on the homologation of the election by popular vote for the judiciary, just as the executive and legislative branches are currently elected. The current judicial system is useless. The reason for which crimes are generated is much greater than what is judged. For serious crimes such as murder or organized crime, they should be removed from society to an island. In a conscious and integral society, anyone could be a judge."
"In other words, empirical experience says that this is useless and is a failure, if so it would have an enormous cost for the victims."
Well said by the Mexican president.
"The meaning of faceless judges is not knowing who is in charge of the trial to avoid reprisals,"
Very cool narrates the news..
"It's not that hard to understand. What is approved today is that the ruler in Mexico now has no counterweights and will be able to do whatever he wants, without anyone judging him."
Very good newspaper answer thank you
"Cordial greetings That's right, no country has to intervene in Sovereignty and less of something that is against corruption, we do not need sultans in the Judiciary, point the people voted and it is respected greetings Nacho"
JUDICIAL REFORM IS EXCELLENT 
"Pure stupidity says this kid, but let's do the right thing, let's stop seeing and listening to him, let's change the medium, until never the media of disinformation."
"Respect for the rights of others is peace, the gringos and any foreign institution or government must respect the sovereignty and the Constitution that governs the rights and obligations of Mexico."
Excellent
"All the people know and have already decided it, out with the rotten judiciary, out with great privileges, out with great salaries, out with great baricia, long live the new reform of the judiciary, long live the progress of the people, the people pay and command"
"THERE IS MY PRECIOUS NACHO!
THE TIGER IS LOOKING FOR TALENT LIKE YOURS, WITH MORAL AUTHORITY, DIGNITY, HONESTY, HONESTY AND HARMONY TO GOVERN THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY."
"The faceless judges I believe I suppose that one of the judges who has been elected by vote will be drawn, the constitutional right to reserve identity for security"
"That the criminal will not know who is going to judge him 
We will vote for the judges we want 
But faceless because you won't know who will pass the sentence."
In the United States there are faceless judges
"Here and everywhere there is corruption, what we need is honest and prepared people"
GO AHEAD WITH THE REFORM. OUT WITH NORMA AND HER DEFENDERS
"Remember Nachito I know you have your own perspective, but knowing television is different, I'm sorry Nachito this time you are not right"
"Voting for judges is fatal
We don't even know the senators for whom we vote 
And then everything by vote???
Hauled and Sold
Some are bad and corrupt, others are worse
Or who to trust
Poor Mexico"
"Desonfirma, I already denounced this video as disinformation."
Judicial power in favor of the corrupt and criminals... and against the people...
Oh q be objective please
"I liked you so much, if only the information was given without editorializing, we would be well informed."
"Congratulations Nacho Lozano, Original way of informing, you started in the Program to whom it corresponds a long time ago and look at yourself now, a Great Professional of the News and a great human being, Blessings Always!! "
"It is the first time that the students of Mexico demonstrate against Mexicans and are in favor of the privileges of corrupt ministers, and even more so because it is a public university, an autonomous university, a university with a history of struggle in favor of the people, it is disappointing."
"Faceless judges are a dubious figure .....
THE WHOLE REFORM IS DOUBTFUL.  
The regime seeks to get away with it...."
Everyone fighting the bone 
"They are not faceless, as the opposition and the media are simplifying. They are determining extra protection measures for those judges. Chale Nacho"
" faceless judges in a trial, not in the election. There is no... What communicators... "
Medina Moorish was ! Accountant! And no one said anything! And he put it fox! But since it's not bread! Now everything is wrong! Ridiculous! And norma piña is already trembling!
"? WE SPENT MILLIONS ON FEDERAL ELECTIONS AND NOW WE WILL ALSO PAY TO ELECT THE PJ. THOSE RESOURCES SHOULD BE USED FOR SOMETHING MORE USEFUL.
IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL EXERCISE JUSTICE WITHOUT CORRUPTION."
Did you fail to say if those who pirated the thesis can apply?
IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE WHO ARE AGAINST THE REFORM.
National march for judicial reform
Canada and the U.S. here in MEXICO don't send ????
"In the United States, most judges are elected by popular vote."
I congratulate you for your work you do it super 
"You are very nice!  Don't talk about what you don't know, you don't have to talk seriously.  Best regards"
"I think that the most indispensable thing is that we must emphasize.
That they are in favor of the progress and development of MEXICO and Mexicans and that they can be tried for crimes of corruption and or delinquency.
It is not concerned with knowing about laws but with what has to be done and they only speak to reject everything that has to do with the people (Mexico)"
It is that in the USA we do vote for judges and it works since the alleged never knows his judge until the trial begins
Chingón the pinche Nacho Lozano.
Damian and Almaguer are very professional just as they want our country
"I'm on the left, but that doesn't mean I hate those who don't think like me.
And I think this senator Damián Zepeda is one of the sanest and most sane that the opposition has"
I'm your fan Hamlet Almaguer 
"That's how all deputies should be, not sold out like the majority and with a lot of ignorance just raise fingers, Damián and Almaguer my respects congratulations"
Damian is another fart. He should be leader of the bread
"I totally agree Damián, we do not want a single absolute power to remain"
"Very good Juan you can always tell how balanced it is! both very good speakers,"
"I like Damián Zepeda's constructive language. It is time to build and not to confront. Hopefully there will be more citizens who will join the construction of better public policies, and stop listening to all those legislators who only seek to confront and destroy"
"That is why we are as we are, and this Mr. Damian ratifies it, there is no opposition in Mexico, we are well screwed."
"Being a López-Obradorista, I recognize that Damián Zepeda is one of the few elements that can be rescued from the PAN. He is not a slum dweller and shouter like Kenya, and he has shown that he is self-critical of his party."
"I am not a PAN member, nor do I share his ideals, however, Damián is a TRUE opposition. He is a prepared person and he is the opposition that is needed."
"Damián Zepeda urges him to distance himself from the PAN and form a party that is a real opposition 
Those of us who believe in the 4th will be at the forefront of this battle but we want a worthy opposition"
"Deputy Hamlet Almaguer is right, we are doing well with our 4T Viva Mexico"
"Hamlet is an expert in electoral matters and constitutional law, he makes the issue of judicial reform very clear."
Hamlet A. The best constitutionalist today. Total support for the 4 T. Damián recognizes that they have done very badly.
"I love the debate with professionals.
Hamlet very coherent. 
Damian Zepeda too. 
And the driver Juan Becerra!!"
"Damián Zepeda is one of the best that the opposition has, he speaks with idea and knowledge. It is even a pleasure to listen to it. Up with the 4T informed and analytical. Mexico has already woken up. ??"
Too bad! Damián Zepeda is very intelligent! Too bad he's in the worst game!
We are with Morena.
"LISTENING TO THESE 2 GUESTS DEBATE LIKE THIS IS A DELIGHT....... ONE IS A SENATOR, VERY SENSIBLE AND VERY INTELLIGENT, THE OTHER IS A VERY BRILLIANT DEPUTY AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE LAW, WELL......... THESE 2 ARE AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH DEBATES BETWEEN POLITICIANS FROM DIFFERENT PARTIES SHOULD BE........ A GREAT SUCCESS BY JUAN BECERRA TO HAVE INVITED THEM............. ONE EVEN WANTS TO LISTEN TO THEM FOR A WHILE."
"The abuse is what the PRIAN did for decades, not constitutionally touching institutions that were ineffective and inefficient just because their relatives and friends worked there. Mexico is no longer to be complacent with anyone, they give results, they stay, they do not give results with the penalty but they leave, that is what the judicial reform offers the Mexican population and that is why the people support it. And the PAN is the one who can least talk about abuses when from one day to the next they sent thousands of Luz y Fuerza workers to the streets. It seems that for them we have first, second and third class Mexicans."
"Very well DAMIÁN I am with Tigo, "
"Damián Zepeda has the same narrative of Ricardo Anaya, pure blah, blah, blah, and at the time of the hour he says NO to everything."
No to the disappearance of autonomous bodies
Mexico needs an opposition leader like Zepeda
"Very good Damián Zepeda, from a Morenita % sanity and coherence above all"
If justice and the judiciary need a change and the first change has to be to remove all the magistrates and judges and then make the necessary adjustments to make it a better justice.
"Damian, I congratulate you for showing that a PAN member, politicized, and not domesticated, because saying no to everything, because justice, is what you say, a person who imparts justifies, has to be, truthful, sinsero, fair and legal, congratulations, because you are not, domesticated, you are politicized, may God bless you."
"The lawyer almaguer as always very punctual and precise in his dialogues, congratulations."
"My respects to Damian, he represents a dignified Right with arguments. Without insults and insults. Hopefully one day in Mexico we will have a respectable opposition."
"Fight corruption? It will be in another country, but in Mexico it is not like that!"
"We need legislators like Damian to solve serious problems of our nation, Mexico needs honest and intelligent people, long live Mexico, live??"
"From the overrepresentation and the PRD Senators, the politicians are losing credibility, but we totally agree that we do NOT want a Judicial Power subordinated to any political party."
The problem is that they want only absolute power and we don't agree with them
"Because the idea of the reform ??? If the same corrupt people stay, we will remain the same, here we are talking about corruption"
"I love Hamlet and Damián, professional people with whom you can really debate, doing work to be able to move the country forward, I wish the rest of the opposition would work like that"
"Hamlet an excellent defender of the people, there is generational change "
"BRAVE  
EXCELLENT GUESTS"
"THE MEDICAL TREATMENT IS VERY POOR, THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH EQUIPMENT"
"He is crazy about the medical service, that there are no medicines, they do not have state-of-the-art medical instruments, good devices that are required, specialists have resigned many for lack of payment"
And these media chayoteros can only cry.
The citizen does see it as good that the reform is applied to the Judiciary
Hamlet masterfully argues
"Juan and Ruiz Healy are the only ones in the formula who are toxic in their way of conducting and moderating the discussion table.

Ciro. López Doriga, among others. "
Damian Cepeda is against the people is going to end up like Alito
How great is the leader of Morena Amlet Almaguer
"PRACTICAL ""LOCKS"" ARE REQUIRED TO PREVENT ABUSE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE CRIMES OF PERJURY AND EMBEZZLEMENT."
"For the good of all, the López Beltrán family first"
"I like to see these debates between thinking and civilized people, I congratulate them!"
"Hamlet was an excellent person, very knowledgeable and always very eloquent and balanced!!"
"You, Mr. Damián, know perfectly well that this is not how the judiciary works"
"DAMIAN. YOU ARE A DECENT PERSON. 40,000 LIGHT AND POWER WORKERS FROM THE CENTER RAN THEM OUT. YOU. AND LIKE THAT. THERE ARE MORE OUTRAGES. DO NOT STAIN. RESPECT YOURSELF"
Damián Zapeda and Mr. Halmaguer very coherent in their participation.
"THESE DEBATES ARE CONSTRUCTIVE 
THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATIC LIFE SHOULD BE"
"Without a doubt, one of the best debates on the subject of the judiciary said by Damián, I do not agree at all, but the discussion in general is not violating the constitution.... and it is that Almaguer said it before that reform will have 3 years to mold the controversies and in general discussions of judicial order so that the 3 powers in their competence are delimited is when congratulations to the 2 panelists"
"He is the only decent and honest senator of the opposition, I congratulate Damián Zepeda"
"My respect for Senator Damian Zepeda for being one of the few opposition members who does not follow decisions or orders from their parties forced or blindly (as in Morena they are doing and give reason to those who call them the new PRI), so in my opinion, that is the opposition that Mexico deserves,  he clarified that in general I support the Morena coalition and allies in its majority, so I differ and I see many mistakes that they have made"
"Good morning All of you, because at minute 1:01 what Mr. Almaguer said stops being heard"
"Damián Zepeda has the key to a real opposition, which moves away from the PAN"
"Everyone knows that the judiciary cannot suspend something that corresponds only to the legislative branch. That piña-ta is not measured and overdone, but it is going to be pelliscar."
